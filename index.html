      <div id="toolkit-overview">
        <p>
        The Harvard College <strong>GenEd 1080 Toolkit</strong> is a collection of resources you can draw from throughout the semester to brush up/level up on your math, music, and coding skills. It’s full of links to helpful videos, explorable web apps, and interesting tangents related to topics in the course.
        </p>

        <p>
        There are no math, music, or coding prerequisites for GenEd 1080, so if you’ve taken high school math, hummed a tune, and used a computer, you should be all set. But if high school feels like forever ago, or if you just want to be sure you know everything you can possibly know, you’ve come to the right place.
        </p>

        <p>
        Each section of the Toolkit has an overview and summary of topics, so you can take a quick look and zero in on the concepts that interest you most.
