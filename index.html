  <h1>Welcome to the GE1080 Toolkit!</h1>
  
  <p>
  The Toolkit is a collection of resources you can draw from throughout the semester to brush up/level up on your math, music, and coding skills. It’s full of links to helpful videos, explorable web apps, and interesting tangents related to topics in the course.
  </p>

  <p>
  There are no math, music, or coding prerequisites for GenEd 1080, so if you’ve taken high school math, hummed a tune, and used a computer, you should be all set. But if high school feels like forever ago, or if you just want to be sure you know everything you can possibly know, you’ve come to the right place.
  </p>

  <p>
  Each section of the Toolkit has an overview and summary of topics, so you can take a quick look and zero in on the concepts that interest you most.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <a href="math.html">Math Section</a> reviews five subjects that are especially relevant to engineering and music. They are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="sine_waves.html">Sine Waves</a>
    <li><a href="logarithms.html">Logarithms</a>
    <li><a href="complex_numbers.html">Complex Numbers</a>
    <li><a href="derivatives_integrals.html">Derivatives and Integrals</a>, and
    <li><a href="diff_eqs.html">Differential Equations</a>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The <a href="music.html">Music Section</a> introduces the physics and math behind musical scales, and covers some basic theory that will help you write a chart-topping hit. It includes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Constructing a Musical System
    <li>The Tonal Center
    <li>Degrees and Intervals
    <li>Chords and Triads
    <li>Rhythm and Meter
  </ul>

  <p>
  The <a href="coding.html">Coding Section</a> is an orientation to the Jupyter Notebooks we’ll be using in the course...
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Installing Jupityr Notebooks
    <li>Jupityr Notebook Tutorials
    <li>Amplitude Modulation
    <li>Chirps and Spectogram
    <li>Compression
    <li>Impulse Response
    <li>Spectrum Synthesis and Analysis
    <li>WavCam
  </ul>
