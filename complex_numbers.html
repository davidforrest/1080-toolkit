Math Toolkit: Complex Numbers

<h2>
How do complex numbers relate to music?
</h2>

<p>
Complex numbers set the stage for some very convenient ways of working with sine waves (and other signals that repeat over time). It‚Äôs possible to capture both the amplitude and phase of a sine wave using a single complex number, and also to express those relationships graphically. Much of the math behind signals is built using complex numbers to take advantage of this efficiency.

<h2>
What are complex numbers?
</h2>

<p>
Complex numbers are a number system where the square root of -1 is declared to be a valid number. For example, the number 4 has two square roots: 2 and -2. But what number would you square to get -4? This is where the square root of -1 (usually called ‚Äú<em>i</em>‚Äù for ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù) comes to the rescue:

</p>

<p>
A complex number can be expressed in terms of two components - a real part and an imaginary part. The real part is what we‚Äôre all used to when we think of numbers: like 1, 3, 5, ùûπ, and so forth. The imaginary part is a real number multiplied by <em>i</em>.
</p>

<p>
Complex numbers are usually graphed on the ‚Äúcomplex plane‚Äù. You may be familiar with the number line, a one-dimensional line that describes all real numbers, with zero in the middle, positive numbers on the right and negatives on the left. the complex plane is a two-dimensional plane, where zero is still in the middle, positives on the right, and negatives on the left, but this time multiples of <em>i</em> go <em>upwards</em> from zero, and multiples of negative <em>i</em> go downwards from zero. So to graph a number a+b<em>i</em>, you‚Äôd go right or left depending on the value of a, then go up or down depending on the value of b.
