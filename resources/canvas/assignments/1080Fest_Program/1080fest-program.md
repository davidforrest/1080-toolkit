# 1080Fest Program

### Welcome to 1080Fest 2020!

This program will be your guide accessing the venue, getting set up, and keeping track of the schedule of events.

#### When's the 'Fest?

It will be held virtually on:  
*Monday December 14th, 10am-12pm EST*.

#### Where's the 'Fest?

It will be on a platform called Gather. Go to this link:  
[https://gather.town/app/Q7Xr2q8jyOKHjP9D/1080Fest](https://gather.town/app/Q7Xr2q8jyOKHjP9D/1080Fest)

And give the bouncer your password:  
`1080FestRocks`

And you're in!

Feel free to stop by the venue in advance to get oriented & test out the space and your presentation. If you have any questions about Gather or how to present (that's not already answered below), don't hesitate to ask a member of the course staff!

Following is everything you need to know about the 1080Fest venue and schedule.

## Big Picture Overview


#### 1. The 'Fest is on Gather.
Gather is a platform where you have a cute avatar that you move around a map. When you get close to other people's avatars, everyone can see and hear each other, just like a Zoom breakout room.

#### 2. There are three different spaces at the 'Fest.

Within Gather, we have a large space for poster-style presentations, and two small performance spaces.

**Poster Sessions** will be held outdoors at *Red Rocks Amphitheatre* in Colorado. Your avatar can set up on a picnic blanket, and people will stroll by to check out your presentation.

**Performances** will be held at the *Bluebird Cafe* in Nashville, and at *Long Pond Studio* in New York. There are magic portals to these venues from the main poster session.âœ¨

**bonus: in Gather, you don't have to stay 6-feet apart or wear a mask!*

#### 3. There are three presentation sessions.

We will rotate between three 30-minute sessions for poster-style presentations. Every group has a spot during one of these sessions. See the schedule below for when and where you're presenting!

#### 4. There are live performances throughout.

There will be performances going on in both small venues throughout the 'Fest. If you requested a performance, see the schedule below for when and where you're performing!

#### 5. You'll do lots of wandering around!

When you're not presenting or performing, you can walk around, talk to groups that are presenting, and watch performances. A whopping 2/3 of your time at the 'Fest will be spent wandering around checking out other projects!

## Some Logistics

Check back soon for more details about what to do when you arrive at the 'Fest, and some logistical points about presenting in Gather.


---
## Notes below here:

What to do when you get there:
- style your avatar, of course
- you can see the whole map by pressing the map icon
- check the schedule. if you're performing, note the time and place. then for your poster session, note the time and space number.
- find your picnic blanket. that's home base

- Gather's [welcome doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FGDyjc1Z7zYctYNwzkUeZ5YZ9qap0iN8/view)

How it will work:
- both group members at your booth.
- People will stop by, and you'll talk.
- Presentations are informal, so you can just chat with whoever stops by, show your video, answer questions, etc. Nothing to prepare beyond having made your project.
- if you're performing, your performance is during your presentation session
- Performances spots are 10min, but you don't have to use all that time.
- if you're seeing or hearing people on the next blanket over, you can shorten your interaction distance.
- the main stage broadcasts to the whole roomWe'll announce session switches & performances from the large stage

Keep Slack open during the 'Fest. If the staff needs to get a message to you and can't do so through Gather, communication will be on Slack.

If, for any reason the Gather platform becomes unusable, we will reconveine in our usual synchronous [class Zoom link](https://harvard.zoom.us/j/93996838627?pwd=QjI3R1c1eU40VjMxKy9QUjVPejZkUT09).
