### Welcome to our first lab build!

<br>

Each Monday after class, you'll get a set of instructions like this one for building the week's lab project.

Your mission: complete the lab build on your own (or with help from your friends and TF on Slack), and then **bring your completed project to your first (virtual) lab section** on Thursday or Friday. During section, we'll share our work, troubleshoot, and dive deeper into the concepts.

Because your lab kit is still making its way through the mail  to you, the *physical* builds will begin in Week 3. This first lab introduces two software tools, **Audacity** and **Python Notebooks**, which we will use throughout the course.

There is an interesting relationship between these two tools. Audacity is a fully featured audio editor, but as with any audio software, what you're able to do is limited by the features and design of the program. As you begin to write your own code, you're looking behind the scenes, gaining insight into how tools like Audacity work, and how you might begin to create custom tools of your own.

<br>

### Part 1: Audacity

<br>

Audacity is a free audio editing and analysis program used by musicians, audio professionals, and researchers alike. The first part of this week's lab will get you started using Audacity to explore and visualize some of the properties of waves we learned about last week.

1. **[Click here](https://student.desmos.com/join/2t5mrr) to launch the Introduction to Audacity.** You will need to log in using your Harvard email address, and you can also save your changes if you need to log out and come back to the activity later on.

1. Since this Monday is a holiday, there will be an **optional class meeting on Wednesday 9/9 at 9:00am**. We'll use this time to work through the Audacity activity together as a group, so please consider scheduling this as your time to do the activity--we'd love to see you there! If you're not able to join the group on Wednesday, you can complete the activity on your own before lab section.

Wednesday's group meeting will be on Zoom at the [normal link](https://harvard.zoom.us/j/93996838627?pwd=QjI3R1c1eU40VjMxKy9QUjVPejZkUT09) for class meetings.

### Part 2: Python Notebooks

<br>

Python is a programming language that's designed to be easy to write and read, and a Python Notebook is an environment for
running Python code along with regular text. The second part of this week's lab will get you started exploring the basics of Python and Python Notebooks.

1. [Click here](https://gened1080.bok.tools/software.html) to open the GenEd 1080 Toolkit, where you will find links to all the notebooks we'll be using throughout the course, as well as video walkthroughs for each notebook.

1. **Open the first notebook**, "Intro to Colabs," and work your way through all the steps. This notebook will get you up and running, and will introduce a Python library for signal processing.

1. Once you've gone through the notebook, **save a copy** to your Google Drive, and **share** it with your TF. [This cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XZZzmM6PcmB7CTSMt9RtXXXCpEbbZWxvXwYO0haIuzk/edit) (also linked inside the notebook) shows you how.

1. When you're done, **Open the second notebook**, "Visualizing Sound," and **watch Salma's video walkthrough** on the Toolkit (it should begin automatically at 5:15). This is the same notebook you saw Prof. Wood use to visualize wave propagation in last week's Physics of Sound II lecture video. Note: the video walkthroughs show the notebook running on Jupyter Hub (rather than Colab), but the functionality is nearly identical.

1. **Play with the notebook!** You can recreate Salma's demo from the video walkthrough, or Prof. Wood's demos from class, and you can also make up some visualizations of your own.

1. Once again, **save a copy** of the notebook to your Google Drive, and **share** it with your TF.

We'll explore some different visualizations during lab section, so if you come up with something cool, save it and share it!

And as always, you can always ask questions, answer questions, and troubleshoot these notebooks on Slack during the week.
