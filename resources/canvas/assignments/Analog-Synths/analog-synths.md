### Objectives

The main goal of this lab is to gain experience with synthesizer modules--the different kinds, and how they chain together to modify an audio signal.

A secondary goal is to understand the relationship of hardware and software--how software can *represent* hardware, and also how hardware and software can control one another to musical ends.

<br>

### Overview  

The process will be to explore VCV Rack modules and build a custom setup to play with.

This can also involve making custom modifications to the Arduino MIDI controller to play the setup, or alternatively, making modifications to the Arduino synth to recreate some (basic) concept in the setup. Establishing that link between software and hardware.

### Basic Module Types  

- **Oscillator**
  - Waveform Shape, LFO...
  - Envelope (Amplitude ADSR)
- **Filter**
  - Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass...  
- **Effect**
  - Distortion, Reverb, Compression, Delay, Equalizer...
- **Sequencer**
  - links the modular concept to DAWs, arpeggiators, programmed events in time...

### Rack modules to explore

Starting to round up staring points, here are screenshots of Rack configurations from Lab and Hans's lecture.

### Extra

We could (perhaps?) include a live demo of Max during lab, and a brief discussion of some other DAWs, software tools, hardware controllers, and hardware synths to open up this field for the electronic instrument and/or final project.
