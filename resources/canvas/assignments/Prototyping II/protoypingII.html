<h3><strong>Overview</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3>
<h4><strong>Sound in pipes*</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(*note: we will discuss wind instruments in class the week of 10/5, including more depth on the theory that is introduced below). Wind instruments are divided into two categories, open ended or close ended. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open ended pipes have both ends open to the air, such as a trumpet, where you blow in one end and the sound emerges from the other end. Close ended pipes have one end closed and the other end open, such as a clarinet, where the end of the pipe is closed off near the mouth piece. Frequencies of sound waves that naturally resonate in pipes are known as harmonics, just as with stringed instruments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing wave patterns are wave patterns produced in a medium when two waves of identical frequencies interfere to produce points along the medium that appear to be standing still. These exist at certain frequencies known as harmonics. There is a clear mathematical relationship between the pipe length and the wavelength of the wave creating the pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10598318/download?wrap=1" alt="harmoics" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10598318" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For close ended pipe like a flute, the smallest wave possible is the fundamental frequency or first harmonic. Consider the following pipe geometry below. The air at the closed end must be at a node where the air does not move. The open end is an antinode where the air has the maximum movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10598323/download?wrap=1" alt="closed end pipe" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10598323" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the pipe length is a quarter of the entire wavelength, this gives the above formula. This can be combined with the equation relating frequency and wavelength to velocity as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10598328/download?wrap=1" alt="equations" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10598328" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For an open ended pipe, the first harmonic must satisfy antinodes at both ends since air can flow at both ends.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10604587/download?wrap=1" alt="open pipe" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10604587" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p>The updated equation for frequency is thus:</p>
<p><img class="equation_image" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="f\:=\:\frac{v}{2L}" src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/equation_images/f%255C%253A%253D%255C%253A%255Cfrac%257Bv%257D%257B2L%257D" alt="LaTeX: f\:=\:\frac{v}{2L}" width="166" height="64" data-equation-content="f\:=\:\frac{v}{2L}" /></p>
<p>Try calculating the same equation for the second and third harmonics for close ended and open ended pipes. What fraction of the wavelength is used in the second and third harmonics? Also, which type of pipe best describes the flute that you will make?</p>

<h4><strong>Kit Safety</strong></h4>
<p>Before you start building anything in your kit, we are required to go over some basic safety information so no one gets hurt. Please watch this short video that both introduces you to what's in your kit and how to safely use the tools and materials we have provided to you. After the video, there will be a short quiz to confirm you have watched it. Since this is an EH&amp;S requirement, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>you will not get credit for your acoustic build unless you pass the quiz</strong> </span>(you can take it multiple times).</p>

<h4><strong>Fabrication Methods</strong></h4>
<p>Hopefully you've had a chance to go through your kit or at least watch the unboxing/safety video above. You'll see that there were many parts in the kits that were custom made just for this class.</p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>3D printing</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">There are a handful of 3D printed parts in your kit, but why? What is 3D printing useful for? Before we go into that, we should explain what it is.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="video-url-fadeable style-scope ytcp-video-info"><a class="style-scope ytcp-video-info" href="https://youtu.be/GmSMec-xM6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/GmSMec-xM6s </a></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Optional: read more about 3D printing at: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing</a></span></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Laser cutting</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Laser cutting works by focusing a beam of light (laser) to a spot size, power, and wavelength that can cut through materials of interest. The power density (power/spot size) and wavelength are the two most important factors that determines whether a material can be cut or not. For instance, CO2 lasers (10600nm, far IR spectrum) are used to cut most plastics, wood, and other organic materials.&nbsp; To cut metals, fiber lasers are used and they typically have a wavelength around 1000nm (far IR). Visible lasers can be used also, but more power is required if the wavelength is not in the optimal zone for absorption. If the wavelength is reflected, then no cutting will occur.<br /></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be able to laser cut the pieces for the kit, a 2D CAD file (which is just a vector image) of the outline we wanted to cut was created. The software then interprets this file and generates what is called G-code, a set of instructions that tells the gantry system of the laser cutter how to move. This whole process if fairly simple and user friendly so you can have parts built within minutes (as compared to 3D printing which usually takes hours). For instance, the total amount of laser cutting time for each kit is about 25 minutes.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10607112/download?wrap=1" alt="laser  cutting" width="541" height="406" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10607112" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Machining</strong></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Machining is the process of removing material to get the desired shape/form that you want. Machining is one of the older styles of manufacturing processes, however it is constantly being updated and refined. Think of old mill buildings where there were saws powered by a water wheel versus now where equipment can be computer controlled and automated. In both cases the act of removing the material is very similar, but the technology for doing so is much different.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For the PVC flutes segments, I could have drilled each hole one by one on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill#/media/File:Drillpress.jpg">drill press</a> or with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill#/media/File:CordlessDrill.jpg">hand drill</a>, but that would have been 600 holes! Instead, I programmed a <a href="https://www.southwesternindustries.com/products/machines/2op-vertical-machining-center">milling machine</a> to cut the holes for me and the complete process took under 3 hours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Equipment and components to be used:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&frac12;&rdquo; PVC Pipe with pre-drilled holes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D printed mouthpiece</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D printed flute segments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3D printed bell</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>The procedure:</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we&rsquo;ll be making a whistle/flute and experimenting with different &ldquo;lengths&rdquo; of pipes. Lengths is in quotations due to the fact that the effective length is determined by whether a hole is covered or not, and note that you have multiple different length pipes. The first step will be to prepare your 3D printed pieces so you get a better sound. Then you&rsquo;ll experiment with different hole sizes and locations to make a flute that you like. It doesn&rsquo;t have to have a particular tuning, but you do have to able to show a short demonstration of you playing it.<br /></span></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Prep the 3D printed pieces</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gather all of the pieces you need for the lab: the mouthpiece, the segments, and the bell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10608638/download?wrap=1" alt="3D printed pieces" width="558" height="418" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10608638" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you look at the mouthpiece, you may notice that the area that is supposed to be sharp for the air to pass over has a step. In order to get a better sound out of your flute, you will need to file this to a point. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/10608658/download?wrap=1" alt="mouthpiece" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.harvard.edu/api/v1/courses/75224/files/10608658" data-api-returntype="File" /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using the flat file, gently file back and forth removing a little material at a time. You can test the sound by plugging the PVC flute segment into the mouthpiece and blowing. NOTE: please wash your mouthpiece with soap and water before putting it in your mouth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="video-url-fadeable style-scope ytcp-video-info"><a class="style-scope ytcp-video-info" href="https://youtu.be/O8Inqk7lJ-o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://youtu.be/O8Inqk7lJ-o </a></span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, file or sand the surfaces where the parts plug together for the segments. Don't get rid of too much material otherwise your flute won't stay together. File/sand just enough so the pieces are still snug but you can pull them apart. Each piece has a "seam" where the 3D printing layer started. Remove that first and then see how it fits.</span>

<h4 style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Make Your Flute</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your pieces prepped, start playing around with different configurations of the pieces.&nbsp; Feel free to have it tuned to however you like. Maybe you want a flute with three holes, maybe you want one with eight. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How close does the flute perform to the calculations above?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when you use the different sized holes?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does your flute sound compared to the PVC flute?</span></li>
