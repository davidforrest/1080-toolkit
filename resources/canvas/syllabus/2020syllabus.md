## Shopping Week & Enrollment Lottery

Thanks for joining us as we explore connections between two very different sides of the human experience: our expression through music, and our ability to design and engineer aspects of the world around us.

Here are a few things you can do to get a feel for the course during shopping week:

- Browse through the **syllabus** (which you're reading right now) to get an overview of the course's topics and structure
- Watch the **course trailer** and **1080 Fest trailer** in the [Course Overview](#course-overview) section below
- Watch the [Intro Lesson](https://harvard.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e553f8c7-f935-4558-b5e3-ac110034514a#) to start diving into the material, and then dive even deeper into [Physics of Sound I](https://harvard.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=349878a8-f595-4080-a9ba-ac0000faf8f5)

<br>

**If you'd like to enroll** in GenEd 1080, here's what to do:

- Since this course has a limit on how many students can enroll, the first thing you need to do is **submit a petition** through your Crimson Cart on my.harvard.
- This petition is your ticket into the GenEd enrollment lottery, and must be submitted **by 11:59pm (Boston time) on Friday, August 21st**. This is very important, because without a petition, GenEd won't know to include you in the lottery!
- GenEd will run the **lottery on Monday, August 24th**, and shortly thereafter, you will see either a green checkmark or a red "x" for the course in your Crimson Cart, indicating whether you're approved to enroll in the course.
- If you see a green checkmark, you've won the lottery! BUT you **must still enroll** through my.harvard before the enrollment deadline of **11:59pm (Boston time) on Wednesday, August 26th**.
- If we still have some spots open after the 26th, anyone who wasn't approved in the lottery but still wishes to enroll can re-petition to add the course.

We've expanded the course's enrollment quite a bit from last year so that more people who want to enroll will be able to. If you're dedicated to joining the course, be sure to stay on track with the material, and you can always reach out to the course staff by email or on the [GenEd 1080 Slack channel](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/external_tools/63266)

If you have questions about the enrollment lottery, GenEd is keeping [this webpage](https://gened.fas.harvard.edu/fall-2020) up to date with the latest info and FAQs, and you can also <a href="mailto:gened_enrollment@fas.harvard.edu">email GenEd</a> with any questions you have.

## Course Overview

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/348453269?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? How and why do singers harmonize? Do high-end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How do electronic synthesizers work? What processes are common in designing a device and composing a piece of music? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for all concentrators, regardless of technical background.

The class is driven by hands-on projects to enhance your technical literacy, and you will learn a variety of skills (rapid prototyping, machining, modeling, etc) while also getting firsthand experience with the topics we discuss in lecture. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social and historical themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. No prior experience beyond high school level calculus and physics is required. Experience with a musical instrument (including voice) is a plus, but is also not required.

<br>

### Acoustic and Electronic Builds

The course is divided into two parts: the first half of the course explores analog and mechanical musical instruments and phenomena; the second half explores electronics, including electrical effects, instruments, playback, and music storage.

The acoustic and electronic topics each culminate in an opportunity to design and build a musical instrument, and to create an original composition related to the unique characteristics of your instrument.

<br>

### Final Project and 1080 Fest

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/384793562?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The semester culminates in a collaborative final project and a science-fair-meets-music-festival called *1080 Fest* to showcase your work.

Final project topics are open-ended, but generally involve one or more of the following:
- design, fabrication, and analysis of a musical device or system (in either software or hardware);
- musical composition using principles discussed in class; and/or
- exploration of a historical or scientific musical event or phenomena.

The acoustic, electronic, and final projects bring together the technical and creative skills you've gained throughout the semester. You're encouraged to let your curiosity guide you and to take advantage of the varied expertise of the teaching staff!

## Remote Weekly Structure

<br>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GEuqyZCiOO_5fS3ZV4NLVucUz4jS0E2r/preview" width="425" height="239.06" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<br>

You can think of each week of GenEd 1080 as a vinyl record (stay tuned for much more on vinyl in [Week 11](#audio-storage-and-transmission)).

The week's topic, like "Physics of Sound," or "Circuits and Synthesizers," is like an album with two sides:
- On **Side A** you'll find everything for our **Class Meeting**, and
- On **Side B**, you'll find everything for **Lab Sections**.

Each side starts out with tracks you listen to on your own, and ends with tracks we listen to as a group. So here's how a given week might look:

<img src="https://gened1080.bok.tools/resources/canvas/media/record_sketch.jpg" alt="The week as a record" width="660"/>

<br>

### Side A - Listen on your own (Class Prep)

During the weekend (before the week starts), you listen on your own to the opening tracks of Side A. These will be things like **lesson videos**, **readings**, **explorables**, and **interesting websites** about the week's topic.

All these materials will be available on the GenEd 1080 Canvas Site (the site you're looking at right now). Canvas will be our central hub for staying on track (pun intended), so be sure to drop in (pun intended) regularly for [course announcements](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/announcements)!

<br>

### Side A - Listen together (Class Meeting)

Then, on Mondays, we'll come together as a group on Zoom. Here, Prof. Wood and the teaching staff will lead **discussions**, **group activities**, **demos**, host **special guests**, and dive into some **deep cuts** to close out Side A.

Depending on your time zone and schedule, you have the option to **sign up for (and attend) *one*** of the following group sessions for this course:
- 9-10:15 a.m. (Boston time) on Mondays, or
- 3-4:15 p.m. (Boston time) on Mondays.

<br>

### Side B - Listen on your own (Lab Prep)

During the early part of the week, we'll flip the record over and start digging into the week's **lab build**. Everyone in the class will receive a **lab swag kit** by mail, full of instrument parts, electronic components, a prototyping board, tools, cables, drum sticks, and everything else you need to be a mad scientist-musician at home.

The first track on Side B will be instructions for building the week's project, which you'll complete on your own (or with your friends) during the middle of the week.

During the Acoustic, Electronic, and Final Project builds, this will be time for you to work on prototyping and iterating on your instrument design and composition.

<br>

### Side B - Listen together (Lab Meetings)

Toward the end of the week, we'll come back together in **lab sections** to troubleshoot what you've built, brainstorm ideas and modifications, and squeeze all the knowledge and experience you can out of your wildly brilliant and interesting lab TFs.

Lab sections are scheduled at the beginning of the semester, and are determined by both the [GenEd 1080 intro survey](https://forms.gle/HHFX4yh65jiEypxD6), and by the Registrar's sectioning tool (to make sure there are no schedule conflicts with your other classes). We'll talk more about scheduling labs during the first week of classes.

<br>

### Extended Play

All throughout the week, there will be ongoing discussions and support on the [GenEd 1080 Slack channel](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/external_tools/63266), where you can get nearly round-the-clock help from a member of the course staff, join a video watch party, or hang out with your TF and watch YouTube videos about nerdy music things.

**How do we design spaces to a particular acoustical goal?** This week we'll extend our analysis of sound propagation into 3D spaces, where detailed models quickly become intractably complex, calling for a new way to analyze how sound reverberates in lecture halls, theaters, and our homes. This is a topic rich in local history, as the first studies on room acoustics were performed by a Harvard professor to improve the quality of Harvard lecture halls.

**What are the connections between mechanical vibrations and the evolution of music theory?** While our previous discussion of music theory described the physical underpinnings of the harmonic series, we will now investigate how this understanding led to the first musical systems: from Pythagoras and Ptolemy to the evolution of just intonation and equal temperament.

### Microphones and Pickups (Transducers)
Week 8 (10/19 - 10/23)

<br>

**How do we transform vibrations into electrical signals?** This week introduces the concept of transduction – converting energy from one form to another – by studying microphones and pickups. We'll introduce electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction, which will also allow us to revisit discussions on sensitivity, bandwidth, and second-order dynamics.

### Circuits and Synthesizers
Week 9 (10/26 - 10/30)

<br>

**How do we manipulate electrical signals?** Now that we have converted mechanical vibrations to electrical signals, this week we'll introduce basic electrical circuit theory. This will be primarily in the context of simple effects such as tone controls. Using this framework, we can revisit time-frequency analysis and introduce concepts such as frequency response and transfer functions.

### Signals and Electronic Effects
Week 10 (11/2 - 11/6)

<br>

**Electrical instruments, synthesis, and digital audio workstations.** In addition to capturing acoustic music using microphones and pickups, we can directly synthesize music electronically. This week we'll describe techniques for music synthesis, including modeling acoustic instruments in electronic form. This module will also introduce very basic concepts in digital signal processing and common effects. For example, we will tie in our discussion of room acoustics and reverberation with reverb effects – one of the most common electronic effects in sound production and live performance.

### Audio Storage and Transmission
Week 11 (11/9 - 11/13)

<br>

**How is music stored?** The 20th century saw a flurry of techniques emerge for analog music storage that forever changed the way that we produce and experience music. This week we will focus on a comparative analysis of records and cassette tapes as the first widespread forms of music storage. Another sea change happened with digital music storage and distribution, and we will also discuss compact discs and MP3 formats with analysis on quality and memory. This will enable us to talk about sampling, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, and error checking/correcting.

**How is music transmitted?** We will also tune in to a historical and technical overview of radio. This expands to more contemporary approaches to transmission such as streaming music, including techniques for compression.
