## Course Overview

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/348453269?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? How and why do singers harmonize? Do high-end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How do electronic synthesizers work? What processes are common in designing a device and composing a piece of music? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for all concentrators, regardless of technical background.

The class is driven by hands-on projects to enhance your technical literacy, and you will learn a variety of skills (rapid prototyping, machining, modeling, etc) while also getting firsthand experience with the topics we discuss in lecture. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social and historical themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. No prior experience beyond high school level calculus and physics is required. Experience with a musical instrument (including voice) is a plus, but is also not required.

<br>

### Acoustic and Electronic Builds

The course is divided into two parts: the first half of the course explores analog and mechanical musical instruments and phenomena; the second half explores electronics, including electrical effects, instruments, playback, and music storage.

The acoustic and electronic topics each culminate in an opportunity to design and build a musical instrument, and to create an original composition related to the unique characteristics of your instrument.

<br>

### Final Project and 1080 Fest

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/384793562?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

The semester culminates in a collaborative final project and a science-fair-meets-music-festival called *1080 Fest* to showcase your work.

Final project topics are open-ended, but generally involve one or more of the following:
- design, fabrication, and analysis of a musical device or system (in either software or hardware);
- musical composition using principles discussed in class; and/or
- exploration of a historical or scientific musical event or phenomena.

The acoustic, electronic, and final projects bring together the technical and creative skills you've gained throughout the semester. You're encouraged to let your curiosity guide you and to take advantage of the varied expertise of the teaching staff!

## Weekly Structure

[Rob's Remote Learning Video]

You can think of each week as a vinyl record (stay tuned for much more on vinyl in [Week 11](#audio-storage-and-transmission)).

Each week's topic, like "Physics of Sound," or "Circuits and Synthesizers," is like an album:
- On **Side A** you'll find everything for our **Class Meeting**, and
- On **Side B**, you'll find everything for **Lab Sections**.

Each side starts out with tracks you listen to on your own, and ends with tracks we listen to as a group. So here's how the week looks:

<img src="https://gened1080.bok.tools/resources/canvas/media/record_sketch.jpg" alt="The week as a record" width="660"/>

### Side A - Listen on your own

During the weekend before the start of the week, you listen on your own to the opening tracks of Side A. These will be things like **lesson videos**, **readings**, **explorables**, and **interesting websites** about the week's topic.

All these materials will be available on the GenEd 1080 Canvas Site (the site you're looking at right now). Canvas will be the central hub for staying on track, so be sure to check in regularly for course [announcements](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/announcements)!

<br>

### Side A - Large group jam

Then, on Mondays, we'll come together as a group on Zoom. Here, Prof. Wood and the teaching staff will lead **discussions**, **group activities**, **demos**, host **special guests**, and dive into some **deep cuts** to close out Side A.

Depending on your time zone and schedule, you have the option to **sign up for (and attend) *one*** of the following group sessions for this course:
- 9-10:15 a.m. (Boston time) on Mondays, or
- 3-4:15 p.m. (Boston time) on Mondays.

<br>

### Side B - Listen on your own

During the early part of the week, flip the record over and start digging into the week's **lab activity**. Everyone in the class will receive a **lab swag kit** by mail, full of instrument parts, electronic components, a prototyping board, tools, cables, drum sticks, and everything else you need to be a mad scientist-musician at home.

The first track on Side B will be instructions for building the week's project, which you'll complete on your own (or with your friends) during the middle of the week.

During the Acoustic, Electronic, and Final Project builds, this will be time for you to work on prototyping and iterating on your design.

<br>

### Side B - Small group jam

Toward the end of the week, we'll come back together in **lab sections** to troubleshoot what you've built, brainstorm ideas and modifications, and squeeze all the knowledge and experience you can out of your wildly brilliant and interesting lab TFs.

Lab sections are scheduled at the beginning of the semester, and are determined by the [GenEd 1080 intro survey](), and by the Registrar's sectioning tool (to make sure there are no schedule conflicts with your other classes).

<br>

### Extended Play

All throughout the week, there will be ongoing discussions and support on the **GenEd 1080 Slack channel**, where you can get nearly round-the-clock help from a member of the course staff, join a video watch party, or hang out with your TF and watch YouTube videos about nerdy music things.

<br>

**What is sound?** This module will explore the physics of sound, including some basic definitions of waves, the universal wave equation, and properties of sound propagation such as the speed of sound, refraction, reflection, and diffraction. This module will also go over some history of our understanding of these phenomena and how they have been exploited throughout human history.

### Physics of Sound (Part 2)
Week 2 (9/7 - 9/11)

<br>

---
### String Instruments and the Harmonic Series
Week 3 (9/14 - 9/18)

<br>

**How is sound produced acoustically?** A first exploration of the vibrations of strings. Discussion of the wave equation and how the solution gives rise to the harmonic series. We will also illustrate how we can model a complex mechanical system, and then reduce the model to simple approximations that allow us to explore concepts of resonance, damping, and a first introduction of the time-frequency duality.


---
### Frequency Analysis and Music Composition
Week 4 (9/21 - 9/25)

<br>

**What are the connections between strategies  for musical composition and engineering design?** Design is all around us. Beyond the ubiquitous examples in architecture and consumer devices, engineering design is present in the transportation, communication, and information systems that we take for granted. Similarly, composers often follow an analogous process for creating a piece of music. This module will outline techniques used in engineering design and musical composition.


---
### Vocal and Auditory Systems in Humans and Animals
Week 5 (9/28 - 10/2)

<br>

**How do we hear?** This module will explore the human auditory system, framing structure and function in an engineering context, with particular emphasis on the importance of impedance matching.


---
### Wind and Percussion Instruments
Week 6 (10/5 - 10/9)

<br>

**How is sound produced acoustically?** A second exploration of the vibrations of plates, harmonic vs. inharmonic instruments, and the motion of air in pipes. This module will allow us to extend our previous analysis of one dimensional systems into 2D and will [build on our discussion of] the human vocal system.


---
### Room Acoustics and Speculative Systems
Week 7 (10/12 - 10/16)

<br>

**How do we design spaces to a particular acoustical goal?** This will further  extend our  analysis of sound propagation into 3D spaces,  where  detailed  models quickly become intractably complex and thus we need a new way to analyze how sound reverberates in lecture halls, theaters, and our homes. This is an area rich in local history as the first studies on this topic were performed by a Harvard professor to improve the quality of Harvard lecture halls.

**What are the connections between mechanical vibrations and the evolution of music theory?** While the previous theory module described the physical underpinnings of the harmonic series, this module will investigate how this understanding led to the first musical systems: from Pythagoras and Ptolemy to the evolution of just intonation and equal temperament.


---
### Microphones and Pickups (Transducers)
Week 8 (10/19 - 10/23)

<br>

**How do we transform vibrations into electrical signals?** This module will introduce the concept of transduction – converting energy from one form to another – by studying microphones and pickups. This will require the introduction of some fundamental principles such as electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction. This will also allow us to revisit discussions on sensitivity, bandwidth, and second-order dynamics.


---
### Circuits and Synthesizers
Week 9 (10/26 - 10/30)

<br>

**How do we manipulate electrical signals?** Now that we have converted mechanical vibrations to electrical signals, this module will introduce basic electrical circuit theory. This will be primarily in the context of simple effects such as tone controls. Using this framework, we can revisit time-frequency analysis and introduce concepts such as frequency response and transfer functions.


---
### Signals and Electronic Effects
Week 10 (11/2 - 11/6)

<br>

**Electrical instruments, synthesis, and digital audio workstations.** In addition to capturing acoustic music using microphones and pickups, we can directly synthesize music electronically.  This module will describe techniques for music synthesis, including modeling acoustic instruments in electronic form. This module will also introduce very basic concepts in digital signal processing and common effects. For example, we will tie in the previous discussion on room acoustics and reverberation with the instantiation of reverb effects – one of the most common electronic effects in sound production and live performance.


---
### Audio Storage and Transmission
Week 11 (11/9 - 11/13)

<br>

**How is music stored?** The 20th century saw a flurry of techniques emerge for analog music storage that forever changed the way that we produce and experience music. This module will primarily focus on a comparative analysis of records and cassette tapes as the first widespread forms of music storage. Another sea change happened with digital music storage and distribution, and we will also discuss compact discs and MP3 formats with analysis on quality and memory. This will enable us to talk about sampling, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, and error checking/correcting.

**How is music transmitted?** This module will describe a historical and technical overview of radio. In addition, more contemporary approaches such as streaming music and techniques for compression will be introduced.


---
### Amplifiers and Speakers
Week 12 (11/16 - 11/20)

<br>

**Playback and amplification.** This module will bring our discussion full circle by investigating transduction in reverse. Topics will include device physics associated with vacuum tubes and more modern semiconductor transistors, basic amplifier concepts and architectures, and the design of speaker drivers, speaker enclosures, and crossover networks.
