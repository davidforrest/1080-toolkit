## Course Overview

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/348453269?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? How and why do singers harmonize? Do high-end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How do electronic synthesizers work? What processes are common in designing a device and composing a piece of music? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for all concentrators, regardless of technical background. The class is driven by hands-on projects to enhance your technical literacy, a critical skill for anyone designing solutions to today’s most pressing and complex issues. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social and historical themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. Requires no previous exposure to physics or calculus beyond the high school level.

The course will be divided into two main topics: the first half of the course will deal with mechan-ical/analog musical phenomena and instruments.  The second half will explore electrical effects,instruments, playback, and music storage. We will reserve a short time at the end of the course forshort discussions on applications of sound in technology.

### Final Project (inst builds & fest)

Students must complete a final project (see Assignments for details). This will conclude with a presentation that will take the place during the time allotted for the GENED 1080 final exam (since there is no final exam for this class): Wednesday, December 11 at 2:00pm (room TBA).

## Grading and Course Policies

### Grading Policy
20% Weekly reading assignments
50% Weekly lab assignments
30% Final project
-1% For each unexcused absence from class or lab. Staff should be informed of absences before class.

### Academic Accommodations

Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with the course head or head TF and present their letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) no later than the end of the second week of the term to develop a plan for implementing accommodations. Please respect this deadline so our teaching staff can respond to your needs in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although faculty may contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation.

### Enrollment

**This course has an enrollment cap and requires that by 11:59 p.m. Thursday, September 5, you use my.harvard to request instructor permission to enroll.** If requests to enroll **do not** exceed available seats, permission to enroll will be granted on Friday, September 6. If interest exceeds available seats, a lottery of those who have requested permission will run on **Friday, September 6**, and all participants will be notified of the results via Harvard email by 5:00 p.m. on **Friday, September 6**.
