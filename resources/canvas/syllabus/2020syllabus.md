How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? How and why do singers harmonize? Do high-end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How do electronic synthesizers work? What processes are common in designing a device and composing a piece of music? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for all concentrators, regardless of technical background. The class is driven by hands-on projects to enhance your technical literacy, a critical skill for anyone designing solutions to today’s most pressing and complex issues. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social and historical themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. Requires no previous exposure to physics or calculus beyond the high school level.

The course will be divided into two main topics: the first half of the course will deal with mechan-ical/analog musical phenomena and instruments.  The second half will explore electrical effects,instruments, playback, and music storage. We will reserve a short time at the end of the course forshort discussions on applications of sound in technology.

### Prerequisite
High school level calculus and physics;
experience with a musical instrument (including voice) is a plus but not required.

Gareth Loy  
Musimathics: The Mathematical Foundations of Music  
MIT Press (Volume 2)  
ISBN: 978-0262516563

### Sections & Labs
We will hold lab sections approximately weekly.  In lab you will learn a variety of skills (rapid prototyping, machining, modeling, etc) while also getting hands-on experience with the topics we discuss in lecture. The labs will closely follow the primary course topics, roughly divided into two halves: In the first half we will explore acoustic instruments and in the second half we will explore electronic instruments. These two halves will be punctuated by instrument design, construction,and composition (i.e., using the instruments you created). Section assignments will be determined shortly after study card day so that labs can begin the second week of class.

Labs are 75 minutes and will be held at the times listed below. Lab attendance is mandatory, so please make sure you have no schedule conflicts with at least one lab time before enrolling in the course:

- Monday 10:30 a.m.
- Monday 1:30 p.m.
- Tuesday 12:00 p.m.
- Tuesday 4:30 p.m.
- Wednesday 1:30 p.m.
- Thursday 12:00 p.m.

Unless otherwise notified, all labs will be held in **Maxwell Dworkin, room B127**


### Final Project (inst builds & fest)

Students must complete a final project (see Assignments for details). This will conclude with a presentation that will take the place during the time allotted for the GENED 1080 final exam (since there is no final exam for this class): Wednesday, December 11 at 2:00pm (room TBA).

Towards  the  end  of  the  semester,  groups  of  students  will  participate  in  a  collaborative  project related to the topics we have explored in the course. This is open-ended, but will generally involve one or more of the following topics:
- design, fabrication, and analysis of a musical device or system (in either software or hard-ware);
- composition using principles discussed in class; and/or
- the exploration of a historical or scientific musical event or phenomena.

It is expected that each member of the group will successfully contribute to the project as a whole, depending on their expertise and/ or area of interest. Groups will be expected to present periodic updates throughout the latter portion of the semester, as well as create a final demonstration and report on their project. More details will be provided later in the course. In past offerings of the course, the final project has been a highlight and we encourage you to let your curiosity guide you and take advantage of the varied expertise of the teaching staff!

### Course website
Please use the course website on Canvas as your first resource for course materials and communications.  Updates will be made daily as appropriate – it is essential that you check the website periodically.  Posts will include lecture notes, interesting websites, course announcements, hand-outs, exercises and assignments, as well as info on the various tools used in the class. We will be using a Jupyter hub (Python) on Canvas with pre-cooked code for you to explore various topics we introduce in class. No coding experience is necessary. Your experience with Python will be guided by your interest to learn more about it.

### Introduction and Physics of Sound
Week 1 (8/31 - 9/4)

**What is sound?** This module will explore the physics of sound, including some basic definitions of waves, the universal wave equation, and properties of sound propagation such as the speed of sound, refraction, reflection, and diffraction. This module will also go over some history of our understanding of these phenomena and how they have been exploited throughout human history.

### Physics of Sound (Part 2)
Week 2 (9/7 - 9/11)

---
### String Instruments and the Harmonic Series
Week 3 (9/14 - 9/18)

**How is sound produced acoustically?** A first exploration of the vibrations of strings. Discussion of the wave equation and how the solution gives rise to the harmonic series. We will also illustrate how we can model a complex mechanical system, and then reduce the model to simple approximations that allow us to explore concepts of resonance, damping, and a first introduction of the time-frequency duality.


---
### Frequency Analysis and Music Composition
Week 4 (9/21 - 9/25)

**What are the connections between strategies  for musical composition and engineering design?** Design is all around us. Beyond the ubiquitous examples in architecture and consumer devices, engineering design is present in the transportation, communication, and information systems that we take for granted. Similarly, composers often follow an analogous process for creating a piece of music. This module will outline techniques used in engineering design and musical composition.


---
### Vocal and Auditory Systems in Humans and Animals
Week 5 (9/28 - 10/2)

**How do we hear?** This module will explore the human auditory system, framing structure and function in an engineering context, with particular emphasis on the importance of impedance matching.


---
### Wind and Percussion Instruments
Week 6 (10/5 - 10/9)

**How is sound produced acoustically?** A second exploration of the vibrations of plates, harmonic vs. inharmonic instruments, and the motion of air in pipes. This module will allow us to extend our previous analysis of one dimensional systems into 2D and will [build on our discussion of] the human vocal system.


---
### Room Acoustics and Speculative Systems
Week 7 (10/12 - 10/16)

**How do we design spaces to a particular acoustical goal?** This will further  extend our  analysis of sound propagation into 3D spaces,  where  detailed  models quickly become intractably complex and thus we need a new way to analyze how sound reverberates in lecture halls, theaters, and our homes. This is an area rich in local history as the first studies on this topic were performed by a Harvard professor to improve the quality of Harvard lecture halls.

**What are the connections between mechanical vibrations and the evolution of music theory?** While the previous theory module described the physical underpinnings of the harmonic series, this module will investigate how this understanding led to the first musical systems: from Pythagoras and Ptolemy to the evolution of just intonation and equal temperament.


---
### Microphones and Pickups (Transducers)
Week 8 (10/19 - 10/23)

**How do we transform vibrations into electrical signals?** This module will introduce the concept of transduction – converting energy from one form to another – by studying microphones and pickups. This will require the introduction of some fundamental principles such as electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction. This will also allow us to revisit discussions on sensitivity, bandwidth, and second-order dynamics.


---
### Circuits and Synthesizers
Week 9 (10/26 - 10/30)

**How do we manipulate electrical signals?** Now that we have converted mechanical vibrations to electrical signals, this module will introduce basic electrical circuit theory. This will be primarily in the context of simple effects such as tone controls. Using this framework, we can revisit time-frequency analysis and introduce concepts such as frequency response and transfer functions.


---
### Signals and Electronic Effects
Week 10 (11/2 - 11/6)

**Electrical instruments, synthesis, and digital audio workstations.** In addition to capturing acoustic music using microphones and pickups, we can directly synthesize music electronically.  This module will describe techniques for music synthesis, including modeling acoustic instruments in electronic form. This module will also introduce very basic concepts in digital signal processing and common effects. For example, we will tie in the previous discussion on room acoustics and reverberation with the instantiation of reverb effects – one of the most common electronic effects in sound production and live performance.


---
### Audio Storage and Transmission
Week 11 (11/9 - 11/13)

**How is music stored?** The 20th century saw a flurry of techniques emerge for analog music storage that forever changed the way that we produce and experience music. This module will primarily focus on a comparative analysis of records and cassette tapes as the first widespread forms of music storage. Another sea change happened with digital music storage and distribution, and we will also discuss compact discs and MP3 formats with analysis on quality and memory. This will enable us to talk about sampling, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, and error checking/correcting.

**How is music transmitted?** This module will describe a historical and technical overview of radio. In addition, more contemporary approaches such as streaming music and techniques for compression will be introduced.


---
### Amplifiers and Speakers
Week 12 (11/16 - 11/20)

**Playback and amplification.** This module will bring our discussion full circle by investigating transduction in reverse. Topics will include device physics associated with vacuum tubes and more modern semiconductor transistors, basic amplifier concepts and architectures, and the design of speaker drivers, speaker enclosures, and crossover networks.


---
### Audio Fingerprinting and Music Copyright
Week 13 (11/23 - 11/27)


---
### Engineering in Music Culture and Practice
Week 14 (11/30 - 12/4) Final week of lectures
