At least one of us is always around on <a href="/courses/91523/external_tools/63266">Slack</a>, and the primary instructors are available for one-on-one or group discussions, in addition to our regular office hours.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="#weekly-structure">Weekly Structure</a> section below for more about how the semester will look, and the <a href="#your-teaching-staff">Teaching Staff</a> section for individual office hours and contact info. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The new SEC Building</strong></p>
<p>If we weren't already excited enough about the course, this year we'll be holding it in the brand new <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-us/visit-us/allston/science-engineering-complex">Science and Engineering Complex</a>. The building is a not-too-long (and scenic!) walk across the river to Allston, near the Athletic Complex and Business School. Check out these photos to get a sense of how amazing it will be to learn, build, and hang out in the SEC:</p>

<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/348453269?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? How and why do singers harmonize? Do high-end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How do electronic synthesizers work? What processes are common in designing a device and composing a piece of music? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for all concentrators, regardless of technical background.</p>
<p>The class is driven by hands-on projects to enhance your technical literacy, and you will learn a variety of skills (rapid prototyping, machining, modeling, etc) while also getting firsthand experience with the topics we discuss in lecture. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social and historical themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. No prior experience beyond high school level calculus and physics is required. Experience with a musical instrument (including voice) is a plus, but is also not required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="acoustic-and-electronic-builds">Acoustic and Electronic Builds</h3>
<p>The course is divided into two parts: the first half of the course explores analog and mechanical musical instruments and phenomena; the second half explores electronics, including electrical effects, instruments, playback, and music storage.</p>
<p>The acoustic and electronic topics each culminate in an opportunity to design and build a musical instrument, and to create an original composition related to the unique characteristics of your instrument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="final-project-and-1080-fest">Final Project and 1080 Fest</h3>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/384793562?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The semester culminates in a collaborative final project and a science-fair-meets-music-festival called <em>1080 Fest</em> to showcase your work.</p>
<p>Final project topics are open-ended, but generally involve one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>design, fabrication, and analysis of a musical device or system (in either software or hardware);</li>
<li>musical composition using principles discussed in class; and/or</li>
<li>exploration of a historical or scientific musical event or phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>The acoustic, electronic, and final projects bring together the technical and creative skills you've gained throughout the semester. You're encouraged to let your curiosity guide you and to take advantage of the varied expertise of the teaching staff!</p>

<h2 id="weekly-structure">Weekly Structure</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can think of each week of GenEd 1080 as a vinyl record (stay tuned for much more on vinyl in <a href="#audio-storage-and-transmission">Week 11</a>).</p>
<p>The week's topic, like "Physics of Sound," or "Circuits and Synthesizers," is like an album with two sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>On <strong>Side A</strong> you'll find everything for our <strong>Class Meeting</strong>, and</li>
<li>On <strong>Side B</strong>, you'll find everything for <strong>Lab Sections</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each side starts out with tracks you listen to on your own, and ends with tracks we listen to as a group. So here's how a given week might look:</p>
<p><img src="https://gened1080.bok.tools/resources/canvas/media/record_sketch_f21.jpg" alt="The week as a record" width="660" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="side-a-">Side A:</h3>
<h3 id="listen-on-your-own-class-prep-">Listen on your own (Class Prep)</h3>
<p>Before coming to class, you listen on your own to the beginning of Side A. These will be things like <strong>readings</strong>, <strong>videos</strong>, and <strong>interactive websites</strong> about the week's topics.</p>
<p>All these materials will be available on the GenEd 1080 Canvas Site (the site you're looking at right now). Canvas will be our central hub for staying on track (pun intended), so be sure to drop in (pun intended) regularly for <a href="/courses/91523/announcements">course announcements</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="listen-together-class-meeting-">Listen together (Class Meeting)</h3>
<p>Then we'll come together as a group in class. This is when Prof. Wood and the teaching staff will give <strong>lectures and demos</strong>, lead <strong>group activities</strong>, host <strong>special guests</strong>, and dive into some <strong>deep cuts</strong> to close out Side A.</p>
<p>Class will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 12:45 - 2:00 pm in the new SEC building (see the introduction section above)</p>
<p><strong>You're required to attend</strong> the weekly class meetings! Please let the course staff know in advance if you need to miss class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="side-b-">Side B:</h3>
<h3 id="listen-on-your-own-lab-prep-">Listen on your own (Lab Prep)</h3>
<p>Then, we'll flip the record over and start digging into the week's <strong>lab build</strong>. The first track on Side B will be a pre-lab reading or activity to get you set up for your lab section.</p>
<p>During the Acoustic, Electronic, and Final Project builds, this will be time for you to work on prototyping and iterating on your instrument design and composition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="listen-together-lab-meetings-">Listen together (Lab Meetings)</h3>
<p>Then, we'll come back together in <strong>lab sections</strong> to build, troubleshoot, brainstorm ideas and modifications, discuss, and squeeze all the knowledge and experience you can out of your wildly brilliant and interesting lab TFs.</p>
<p>Lab sections are scheduled at the beginning of the semester, and are determined by both the GenEd 1080 intro survey, and by the Registrar's sectioning tool (to make sure there are no schedule conflicts with your other classes).</p>
<p><strong>You're required to attend</strong> lab section each week! Please let the course staff know in advance if you need to miss a lab, or if there's a week when you need to attend an alternate lab section time. Please note that labs take the place of a discussion section... i.e., there are three meetings each week: two lectures and a lab, but no additional discussion section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="extended-play">Extended Play</h3>
<p>All throughout the week, there will be ongoing discussions and support on the <a href="/courses/91523/external_tools/63266">GenEd 1080 Slack channel</a>, where you can get nearly round-the-clock help from a member of the course staff, or from fellow students.</p>
<p>Beyond Slack, the primary instructors, TFs, and Active Learning Labs staff will hold regular office hours (see the <a href="#your-teaching-staff">Teaching Staff</a> section below), and are also happy to set up additional one-on-one or group discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="your-teaching-staff">Your Teaching Staff</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each and every staff member is happy to chat with you about any aspects related to your semester and GenEd 1080 in particular. Your lab TF is your go-to person for questions and troubleshooting: they will track your progress and help identify resources that you need. The Active Learning Labs team (their area of expertise and contact information are listed below) are happy to discuss your projects and progress as well. They will be available in office hours, and can also arrange to meet with you at other convenient times. The primary instructors are available to discuss any aspect of the course and to answer your questions at any time.</p>

<p>I'm a PhD candidate in music theory, and this is my third year as Head TF for GenEd 1080. I care a lot about beginner music learning, and especially about our ability (and responsibility) to <em>design</em> music concepts, much like we design music products. I love how GenEd 1080 opens up creative possibilities that couldn't exist in an engineering or music course alone.</p>
<p>Although I'm not leading a lab section this semester, I'll be very involved in the composition, theory, and music copyright sections of the course, as well as the instrument builds. I'm a great person to help you brainstorm ideas for your project, or to help dream up a wild new tuning system or interface for your instrument.</p>

One of these projects is especially relevant to this course - we are working among an interdisciplinary group to develop hydrophone-equipped tags that will be stuck onto whales to record their sounds, and ultimately allow us to decode whale communication. On the music side, I've had varying amounts of experience playing piano, guzheng, guitar, and trumpet, and nowadays, will tinker around on a keyboard whenever I can get my hands on one.</p>

<p><strong>How is sound produced acoustically?</strong> A first exploration of the vibrations of strings. Discussion of the wave equation and how the solution gives rise to the harmonic series. We will also illustrate how we can model a complex mechanical system, and then reduce the model to simple approximations that allow us to explore concepts of resonance, damping, and a first introduction of the time-frequency duality.</p>

<p>Week 4 (Sep 20 - 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the connections between strategies for musical composition and engineering design?</strong> Design is all around us. Beyond the ubiquitous examples in architecture and consumer devices, engineering design is present in the transportation, communication, and information systems that we take for granted. Similarly, composers often follow an analogous process for creating a piece of music. This week we'll outline techniques used in both engineering design and musical composition.</p>

<p>Week 5 (Sep 27 - Oct 1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we vocalize?</strong> This week we'll take a look at how our own vocal cords work, and how they relate to the principles we've already modeled in vibrating strings.</p>
<p><strong>How do we hear?</strong> We'll also explore the human auditory system, framing its structure and function in an engineering context, with particular emphasis on the importance of impedance matching.</p>

<p>Week 7 (Oct 11 - 15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we design spaces to a particular acoustical goal?</strong> This week we'll extend our analysis of sound propagation into 3D spaces, where detailed models quickly become intractably complex, calling for a new way to analyze how sound reverberates in lecture halls, theaters, and our homes. This is a topic rich in local history, as the first studies on room acoustics were performed by a Harvard professor to improve the quality of Harvard lecture halls.</p>
<p><strong>What are the connections between mechanical vibrations and the evolution of music theory?</strong> While our previous discussion of music theory described the physical underpinnings of the harmonic series, we will now investigate how this understanding led to the first musical systems: from Pythagoras and Ptolemy to the evolution of just intonation and equal temperament.</p>

<p>Week 8 (Oct 18 - 22)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we transform vibrations into electrical signals?</strong> This week introduces the concept of transduction &ndash; converting energy from one form to another &ndash; by studying microphones and pickups. We'll introduce electromagnetism and electromagnetic induction, which will also allow us to revisit discussions on sensitivity, bandwidth, and second-order dynamics.</p>

<p>Week 9 (Oct 25 - 29)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we manipulate electrical signals?</strong> Now that we have converted mechanical vibrations to electrical signals, this week we'll introduce basic electrical circuit theory. This will be primarily in the context of simple effects such as tone controls. Using this framework, we can revisit time-frequency analysis and introduce concepts such as frequency response and transfer functions.</p>

<p>Week 10 (Nov 1 - 5)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Electrical instruments, synthesis, and digital audio workstations.</strong> In addition to capturing acoustic music using microphones and pickups, we can directly synthesize music electronically. This week we'll describe techniques for music synthesis, including modeling acoustic instruments in electronic form. This module will also introduce very basic concepts in digital signal processing and common effects. For example, we will tie in our discussion of room acoustics and reverberation with reverb effects &ndash; one of the most common electronic effects in sound production and live performance.</p>

<p>Week 11 (Nov 8 - 12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is music stored?</strong> The 20th century saw a flurry of techniques emerge for analog music storage that forever changed the way that we produce and experience music. This week we will focus on a comparative analysis of records and cassette tapes as the first widespread forms of music storage. Another sea change happened with digital music storage and distribution, and we will also discuss compact discs and MP3 formats with analysis on quality and memory. This will enable us to talk about sampling, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, and error checking/correcting.</p>
<p><strong>How is music transmitted?</strong> We will also tune in to a historical and technical overview of radio. This expands to more contemporary approaches to transmission such as streaming music, including techniques for compression.</p>
