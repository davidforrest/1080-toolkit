<p><strong>The new SEC Building</strong></p>
<p>If we weren't already excited enough about the course, this year we'll be holding it in the brand new <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-us/visit-us/allston/science-engineering-complex">Science and Engineering Complex</a>. The building is a not-too-long (and scenic!) walk across the river to Allston, near the Athletic Complex and Business School. Check out these photos to get a sense of how amazing it will be to learn, build, and hang out in the SEC:</p>

<p><span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>Note:</strong> We will hold a live preview session for GENED 1080 on Wednesday, August 25th at noon EST. Please join us if you are interested to chat about the course, meet the instructors, or if you have any questions! Here is the <a class="inline_disabled" style="background-color: #fbeeb8;" href="https://harvard.zoom.us/j/91687657697?pwd=UzdKQ3lTNVpFdWFHWWR3YkVYOUtSQT09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>.</span></p>
<p>How does Shazam know what song is playing? Why do some rooms have better acoustics than others? How and why do singers harmonize? Do high-end musical instruments sound better than cheap ones? How do electronic synthesizers work? What processes are common in designing a device and composing a piece of music? How is music stored and manipulated in a digital form? This class explores these and related themes in an accessible way for all concentrators, regardless of technical background.</p>
<p>The class is driven by hands-on projects to enhance your technical literacy, and you will learn a variety of skills (rapid prototyping, machining, modeling, etc) while also getting firsthand experience with the topics we discuss in lecture. The projects are designed so that the creativity of students in all fields will have a role to play. Lectures, demonstrations, and guest lecturers/performers are integrated into the class to build foundational knowledge and to inspire. We will also explore wider social and historical themes related to music and acoustics. The class is approached from an engineering perspective, using music and musical instruments as the framework to introduce a broad array of concepts in physics, mathematics, and engineering. No prior experience beyond high school level calculus and physics is required. Experience with a musical instrument (including voice) is a plus, but is also not required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="acoustic-and-electronic-builds">Acoustic and Electronic Builds</h3>
<p>The course is divided into two parts: the first half of the course explores analog and mechanical musical instruments and phenomena; the second half explores electronics, including electrical effects, instruments, playback, and music storage.</p>
<p>The acoustic and electronic topics each culminate in an opportunity to design and build a musical instrument, and to create an original composition related to the unique characteristics of your instrument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="final-project-and-1080-fest">Final Project and 1080 Fest</h3>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/384793562?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=8dc7dc" width="425" height="350" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The semester culminates in a collaborative final project and a science-fair-meets-music-festival called <em>1080 Fest</em> to showcase your work.</p>
<p>Final project topics are open-ended, but generally involve one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>design, fabrication, and analysis of a musical device or system (in either software or hardware);</li>
    <li>musical composition using principles discussed in class; and/or</li>
    <li>exploration of a historical or scientific musical event or phenomena.</li>
</ul>
<p>The acoustic, electronic, and final projects bring together the technical and creative skills you've gained throughout the semester. You're encouraged to let your curiosity guide you and to take advantage of the varied expertise of the teaching staff!</p>

<h2 id="weekly-structure">Weekly Structure</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can think of each week of GenEd 1080 as a vinyl record (stay tuned for much more on vinyl in <a href="#audio-storage-and-transmission">Week 11</a>).</p>
<p>The week's topic, like "Physics of Sound," or "Circuits and Synthesizers," is like an album with two sides:</p>
<ul>
    <li>On <strong>Side A</strong> you'll find everything for our <strong>Class Meeting</strong>, and</li>
    <li>On <strong>Side B</strong>, you'll find everything for <strong>Lab Sections</strong> and <strong>Projects</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each side starts out with tracks you listen to on your own, and ends with tracks we listen to as a group. So here's how a given week might look:</p>
<p><img src="https://gened1080.bok.tools/resources/canvas/media/record_sketch_f21.jpg" alt="The week as a record" width="660" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="side-a-">Side A:</h3>
<h3 id="listen-on-your-own-class-prep-">Listen on your own (Class Prep)</h3>
<p>Before coming to class, you listen on your own to the beginning of Side A. These will be things like <strong>readings</strong>, <strong>videos</strong>, and <strong>interactive websites</strong> about the week's topics.</p>
<p>All these materials will be available on the GenEd 1080 Canvas Site (the site you're looking at right now). Canvas will be our central hub for staying on track (pun intended), so be sure to drop in (pun intended) regularly for <a href="/courses/91523/announcements">course announcements</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="listen-together-class-meeting-">Listen together (Class Meeting)</h3>
<p>Then we'll come together as a group in class. This is when Prof. Wood and the teaching staff will give <strong>lectures and demos</strong>, lead <strong>group activities</strong>, host <strong>special guests</strong>, and dive into some <strong>deep cuts</strong> to close out Side A.</p>
<p>Class will be held on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 12:45 - 2:00 pm in the new SEC building (see the introduction section above)</p>
<p><strong>You're required to attend</strong> the weekly class meetings! Please let the course staff know in advance if you need to miss class.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="side-b-">Side B:</h3>
<h3 id="listen-on-your-own-lab-prep-">Listen on your own (Lab Prep)</h3>
<p>Then, we'll flip the record over and start digging into the week's <strong>lab build</strong>. The first track on Side B will be a pre-lab reading or activity to get you set up for your lab section.</p>
<p>During the Acoustic, Electronic, and Final Project builds, this will be time for you to work on prototyping and iterating on your instrument design and composition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="listen-together-lab-meetings-">Listen together (Lab Meetings)</h3>
<p>Then, we'll come back together in <strong>lab sections</strong> to build, troubleshoot, brainstorm ideas and modifications, discuss, and squeeze all the knowledge and experience you can out of your wildly brilliant and interesting lab TFs.</p>
<p>Lab sections are scheduled at the beginning of the semester using the Registrar's sectioning tool (to make sure there are no schedule conflicts with your other classes).</p>
<p><strong>You're required to attend</strong> lab section each week! Please let the course staff know in advance if you need to miss a lab, or if there's a week when you need to attend an alternate lab section time. Please note that labs take the place of a discussion section... i.e., there are three meetings each week: two lectures and a lab, but no additional discussion section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="extended-play">Extended Play</h3>
<p>All throughout the week, there will be ongoing discussions and support on the <a href="/courses/91523/external_tools/63266">GenEd 1080 Slack channel</a>, where you can get nearly round-the-clock help from a member of the course staff, or from fellow students.</p>
<p>Beyond Slack, the primary instructors, TFs, and Active Learning Labs staff will hold regular office hours (see the <a href="#your-teaching-staff">Teaching Staff</a> section below), and are also happy to set up additional one-on-one or group discussions.</p>

<p>I'm a PhD candidate in music theory, and this is my third year as Head TF for GenEd 1080. I care a lot about beginner music learning, and especially about our ability (and responsibility) to <em>design</em> music concepts, much like we design music products. I love how GenEd 1080 opens up creative possibilities that couldn't exist in an engineering or music course alone.</p>
<p>Although I'm not leading a lab section this semester, I'll be very involved in the composition, theory, and music copyright sections of the course, as well as the instrument builds. I'm a great person to help you brainstorm ideas for your project, or to help dream up a wild new tuning system or interface for your instrument.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm a PhD student at the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://softmath.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soft Math Lab</a> with a background in applied math and computer science. <span>Over my first few years I've worked on a range of projects such as trajectory optimization for robotics, models of visual processing, and analysis of gait. But </span>I'm most interested in <span>the use of computational methods to assist sustainability and wildlife conservation, and particularly in bioacoustics: the study of sound to observe and monitor vocal animals such as birds, frogs, or whales. Really looking forward to meeting everyone!!</span></p>

One of these projects is especially relevant to this course - we are working among an interdisciplinary group to develop hydrophone-equipped tags that will be stuck onto whales to record their sounds, and ultimately allow us to decode whale communication. On the music side, I've had varying amounts of experience playing piano, guzheng, guitar, and trumpet, and nowadays, will tinker around on a keyboard whenever I can get my hands on one.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Weekly lab builds and participation in lab section comprise 50% of the course grade.</li>
    <li>There are 8 "regular" lab assignments, and two instrument build/composition assignments.</li>
    <li>Each regular lab assignment is graded out of three points:
        <ul>
            <li>1 point for completing the pre-lab activity.</li>
            <li>1 point for attempting the basic lab activities, but incomplete post-lab deliverables.</li>
            <li>1 point for completing the basic lab activities and turning in post-lab deliverables.</li>
            <li>In addition, a bonus point may be given for successfully completing the advanced portion of the lab (and turning in any associated deliverables). Note that not all labs will have an advanced portion.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Each of the two instrument builds is graded out of 13 points:
        <ul>
            <li>The rubric for each instrument build and composition assignment will be detailed in the assignment prompts.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Project (30%)</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The final project comprises 30% of your course grade.</li>
    <li>This will consist of a preliminary project proposal, a final project submission, and participation in 1080 Fest. The rubric for the Final Project will be detailed in the assignment prompt.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="late-policy">Late Policy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All lab assignments are due prior to the beginning of your assigned weekly lab section meeting, unless otherwise specified.</li>
    <li>All lab assignments will be posted on Canvas and will require an upload that will be timestamped.</li>
    <li>All students get a total of four late days they can bank over the course of the semester. If you anticipate being late completing a lab assignment, please notify your lab TF in advance.</li>
    <li>If your assignments are, in aggregate, more than four days late, subsequent late assignments will not be considered complete and will carry a maximum score of 2pts (i.e., if the lab was attempted and submitted, and if you participated in the synchronous lab activity).</li>
    <li>Banked late assignments can be used for any assignment<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>except for the final project</strong>.</li>
    <li>If you have extenuating circumstances that will cause you to have more than four late days (aggregated), please contact a member of the course staff to discuss alternate arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="academic-accommodations">Academic Accommodations</h3>
<p>Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations should speak with the course head or head TF and present their letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) no later than the end of the second week of the term to develop a plan for implementing accommodations. Please respect this deadline so our teaching staff can respond to your needs in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although faculty may contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation.</p>

<h3 id="string-instruments-and-music-composition">String Instruments and Music Composition</h3>
<p>Week 3 (Sep 13 - 17)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is sound produced acoustically?</strong> A first exploration of the vibrations of strings. Discussion of the wave equation and how the solution gives rise to the harmonic series. We will also illustrate how we can model a complex mechanical system, and then reduce the model to simple approximations that allow us to explore concepts of resonance, damping, and a first introduction of the time-frequency duality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the connections between strategies for musical composition and engineering design?</strong> Design is all around us. Beyond the ubiquitous examples in architecture and consumer devices, engineering design is present in the transportation, communication, and information systems that we take for granted. Similarly, composers often follow an analogous process for creating a piece of music. This week we'll outline techniques used in both engineering design and musical composition.</p>

<h3 id="circuits-and-synthesizers">Circuits and Synthesizers</h3>
<p>Week 9 (Oct 25 - 29)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we manipulate electrical signals?</strong> Now that we have converted mechanical vibrations to electrical signals, this week we'll introduce basic electrical circuit theory. This will be primarily in the context of simple effects such as tone controls. Using this framework, we can revisit time-frequency analysis and introduce concepts such as frequency response and transfer functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>How do synthesizers and digital audio workstations work?</strong> In addition to capturing acoustic music using microphones and pickups, we can directly synthesize music electronically. This week we'll describe techniques for music synthesis, including modeling acoustic instruments in electronic form. This module will also introduce very basic concepts in digital signal processing and common effects. For example, we will tie in our discussion of room acoustics and reverberation with reverb effects &ndash; one of the most common electronic effects in sound production and live performance.</span></p>

<p>Week 11 (Nov 8 - 12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is music stored?</strong> The 20th century saw a flurry of techniques emerge for analog music storage that forever changed the way that we produce and experience music. This week we will focus on a comparative analysis of records and cassette tapes as the first widespread forms of music storage. Another sea change happened with digital music storage and distribution, and we will also discuss compact discs and MP3 formats with analysis on quality and memory. This will enable us to talk about sampling, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, and error checking/correcting.</p>
<p><strong>How is music transmitted?</strong> We will also tune in to a historical and technical overview of radio. This expands to more contemporary approaches to transmission such as streaming music, including techniques for compression.</p>
