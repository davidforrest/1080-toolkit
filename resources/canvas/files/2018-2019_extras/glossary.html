<p><strong>Partial:</strong> any of the sine waves that make up a complex tone.&nbsp; Unlike a harmonic, a partial's frequency does not have to be an integer multiple of the base frequency (fundamental) of the tone.</p>
<p><span><strong>Harmonic:</strong> a partial whose frequency is an integer multiple of a tone's fundamental frequency. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Overtone:</strong> any partial above the lowest one (the fundamental frequency).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Vibration:</strong> the physical motion (mechanical, periodic) induced by a force on an object.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Oscillation:</strong> a periodically changing quantity that we observe or calculate. For example, we might observe a vibration (say in many directions) and decompose it into oscillations.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Boundary conditions:</strong> description of string motion, air pressure, etc. at specific locations on an instrument.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Initial conditions:</strong> description of string motion, air pressure, etc. at a specific time, most typically at the onset of a vibration.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Node:</strong> point on an instrument or in a medium where there is no motion.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Anti-node:</strong> point on an instrument or in a medium where there is maximum motion.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Traveling wave:</strong> any vibration pattern that has moving nodes and anti-nodes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Standing wave:</strong> any vibration pattern that produces constant nodes and anti-nodes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Equilibrium:</strong> the state of a system characterized by balance between all forces involved.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nut/Bridge:</strong> on a stringed instrument, the nut is the node furthest from the body and the bridge is the node attached to the body. The nut and bridge form no-displacement boundary conditions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Half-step (aka semitone):</strong>&nbsp;distance between two adjacent pitches on the piano.</p>
<p><span><strong>Cent:&nbsp;</strong>1/100 of a half-step.</span></p>
<p><strong>Whole-step (aka tone):</strong>&nbsp;the distance of two half-steps on the piano (e.g. C to D - there is a black note in between).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Interval: </strong>relative&nbsp;distance between two pitches (in music). Each integer distance in semitones corresponds has a few interval names.&nbsp;Each interval has a distinctive sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0&nbsp;half-step : "perfect unison" or "unison"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp;half-step : "minor second"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 half-steps: "major second"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 half-steps: "minor third"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 half-steps: "major third"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 half-steps: "perfect fourth"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6 half-steps:&nbsp;"augmented fourth" or "diminished fifth"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 half-steps: "perfect fifth"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 half-steps: "minor sixth"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9 half-steps: "major sixth"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 10 half-steps: "minor seventh"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 11 half-steps: "major seventh"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 12 half-steps: "perfect octave" or "octave"</p>
<p><strong>Consonant interval:&nbsp;</strong>a harmonious sounding interval. Psycho-acoustically, we tend to favor intervals where harmonics of the two pitches involved line up.</p>
<p><strong>Dissonant interval:</strong> an inharmonious sounding interval. Harmonics/ overtones of the two pitches tend not to line up, so we hear this as "clashy".</p>

<p><strong>Some Synthesis Terms:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>MIDI</strong>: the standard protocol for communicating basic musical communication in the digital domain: essentially this is a set of rules that got agreed upon in the 80s and has been used in the music technology community ever since! The MIDI protocol is what allows you to plug a musical keyboard into your computer and have software on the computer know which note you want to be played.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Oscillator</strong>: Generates the fundamental signal shape fed into the synth &nbsp;&mdash; for example a sine wave, or something more complicated &mdash; that is being filtered and later output as sound.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Envelope</strong>: Controls the amplitude profile of sounds played by the synth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Filter</strong>: amplifies some frequencies and attenuates others. Recall the low-pass filter, from the first lab assignment, which we used to remove high frequencies from our signal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>VCA</strong>: combines and amplifies signals before the sound is finally transduced through speakers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>CV</strong>: (in modular synthesis) stands for &ldquo;control voltage&rdquo;. Varying signal inputs to one of these inlets can be used to change a parameter of a module dynamically (e.g. the amplitude multiplication factor of a VCA). When an envelope is triggered it generates a continuously varying sequence of control voltages or a control signal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Sequencer</strong>: Automatically generates a repeating (pre-programmed) sequence of notes in time with a pulse (or trigger signal).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Low frequency oscillator (LFO)</strong>: generates a periodic control voltage, generally at a much lower frequency than the &ldquo;oscillators&rdquo; as we have encountered them so far. Recall that a control voltage controls some parameter of another module, e.g. the cutoff of a filter.</span></p>
