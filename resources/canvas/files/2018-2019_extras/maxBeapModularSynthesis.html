<h1>Max, BEAP and Modular Synthesis</h1>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction to Max, BEAP and Modular Synthesis</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download and install Max </span><a href="https://cycling74.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://cycling74.com/downloads</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be able to use Max for free (without saving capability), or begin a free trial (with saving) that lasts 30 days. Thereafter, the software can be rented for $10 per month (should you wish to use it in your final project -- this could come out of your budget).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open up Max. You should be prompted to take the &ldquo;tour&rdquo;, which is a great way to get a flavor for the vast array of capabilities that Max has as a programming environment!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you are done, you will enter a blank patching window (a patch is just a bunch of max objects connected together, as you saw in the tour). There are a number of buttons around the edge of the screen. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">most</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> important one for working in Max is that in the bottom left corner (&ldquo;lock/unlock&rdquo;). When the patch is &ldquo;locked&rdquo;, we enter performance mode; when the patch is &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; we enter edit mode, which means we can create objects and connect them together (in order to pass data or audio signals between them).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When toggling the lock/unlock button, you should be prompted in the upper right corner to begin your trial. You will have to begin the trial to save your work!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple spots above the lock/unlock button on the side-menu is a &ldquo;b&rdquo;, which stands for BEAP, a &ldquo;modular synthesizer&rdquo; that can be used inside of Max. The term modular synthesizer will make more sense as you gain more familiarity with BEAP &mdash; it is a means of synthesizing sounds by connecting together various modules in a wide variety of orders and orientations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at </span><strong>Part 1</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this series of BEAP tutorials </span></p>
<p><a href="https://cycling74.com/tutorials/a-few-minutes-with-beap-tutorial-series" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://cycling74.com/tutorials/a-few-minutes-with-beap-tutorial-series</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow along in your copy of Max. Remember to make sure you are in edit mode when you are making the patch, and performance mode when you want to play it and tweak the parameter controls on any of the BEAP objects. You will not be able to trigger notes unless you have a MIDI controller (see MIDI in the glossary of terms below). Fortunately, you will be making your own MIDI controller in lab this week, so please bring a copy of the patch that you make while following on with the tutorial so that you can complete your instrument!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;You will also find a copy of the tutorial part 1 file saved in Files under Labs/Lab7!</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms and Concepts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some terms will come up in the BEAP tutorial that may be unfamiliar. You can learn more about all the following terms and concepts in chapter 3 of </span><a href="http://hollis.harvard.edu/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=HVD&amp;institution=HVD&amp;docId=HVD_ALEPH013917387" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this book</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by clicking </span><a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/book/hobbies/9781449356200/3dot-analog-synthesizer-building-blocks/ch03_html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and/or by reading the short glossary below! The book treats the same ideas that we will learn about through BEAP in the analog circuits domain, which is really what BEAP is trying to emulate (see CV -- or &ldquo;control voltage&rdquo; -- below for an example of vocabulary held over from circuit analysis), but it is much easier to play around with in software.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some terms that may be unfamiliar or need review:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MIDI: the standard protocol for communicating basic musical communication in the digital domain: essentially this is a set of rules that got agreed upon in the 80s and has been used in the music technology community ever since! The MIDI protocol is what allows you to plug a musical keyboard into your computer and have software on the computer know which note you want to be played.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oscillator: Generates the fundamental signal shape fed into the synth &nbsp;&mdash; for example a sine wave, or something more complicated &mdash; that is being filtered and later output as sound. The first few minutes of </span><strong>Part 2</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the BEAP tutorial series might be helpful for learning a little bit about oscillators. Don&rsquo;t worry too much about the section on &ldquo;FM&rdquo; that follows. This is a rather deep topic in synthesis that we don&rsquo;t need to go into to understand the fundamentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envelope: Controls the amplitude profile of sounds played by the synth. </span><strong>Part 4 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the BEAP tutorial gives.a clearer visual depiction of envelopes and how they work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filter: amplifies some frequencies and attenuates others. Recall the low-pass filter, from the first lab assignment, which we used to remove high frequencies from our signal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCA: combines and amplifies signals before the sound is finally transduced through speakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CV inputs: stands for &ldquo;control voltage&rdquo;. You will notice that certain inlets at the top of BEAP objects are labeled CV. Varying signal inputs to one of these inlets can be used to change a parameter of a module dynamically (e.g. the amplitude multiplication factor of a VCA). When an envelope is triggered it generates a continuously varying sequence of control voltages or a control signal.</span><br /><br /></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some other fundamental concepts in synthesis:</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequencers: Automatically generate sequences of notes. Check out</span><strong> Part 3</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the BEAP tutorial for some examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low frequency oscillators (LFOs): generate a periodic control voltage, generally at a much lower frequency than the &ldquo;oscillators&rdquo; as we have encountered them so far. Recall that a control voltage controls some parameter of another module, e.g. the cutoff of a filter.</span><br /><br /></p>
