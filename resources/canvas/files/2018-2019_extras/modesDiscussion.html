<h1>Please help! Kate and Jim are going off on tangents!</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this all started with when we asked&nbsp;Jim if he would please find songs in different scales so&nbsp;we can put the different scales Prof. Dabby discussed in class in context with familiar songs. The conversation is now spiraling from Jane's Addiction to memes on colors of dresses that I can't possibly follow... I am moving parts&nbsp;of the discussion to this board,&nbsp;as I&nbsp;think some of you in class may enjoy this better than I with my challenged tone-deaf ear!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>We'll start with Jim's list and then Kate's list and then they debate! Do you have anything to add to this? GO!</strong></span></p>

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">I know, these descriptions will make serious musicians cringe...&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Of the seven modes we discussed, one is never used, so that leaves six, and two you probably already know: major (Ionian) and natural minor (Aeolian), so that leaves four new ones.&nbsp; In order, using only the white keys and starting on C:<br />Ionian (start on C) is simply a major scale.<br />Dorian (start on D, for Dorian) for&nbsp;many&nbsp;English folk song &nbsp;(Scarborough Fair).&nbsp; Also Eleanor Rigby.<br />Phrygian (start on E)&nbsp;for&nbsp;many Spanish folk songs...&nbsp;</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Lydian (start on F) is a major scale with a sharp four, used in every John Williams film score:<br /><a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6FbC96CX4E" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dx6FbC96CX4E&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518873422031000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSUSkHS4HDbxnNSA7mSJGjgfcuKw" data-preview-alt="Film Scoring 101 - The Lydian Mode">Film Scoring 101 - The Lydian Mode</a></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Mixolydian (start on G) is a major scale with a flat seven.&nbsp; Think the beginning of "Norwegian Wood" or Blind Melon's "No Rain"</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Aeolian (start on A) is just natural minor</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">Locrian (start on B) is rare enough that you can safely ignore it.</div>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>!! THE DEBATE !!</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Jim:&nbsp;</strong>You might want to 86 the "Jane Says" example.&nbsp; I know that some of the sites call it G-Lydian, but most of the sheet music I've Googled have it in vanilla D-maj., which is certainly how I hear it.</span></p>
<p><strong>Kate:</strong>&nbsp;Agree to disagree? This is why I think modes are great; It&rsquo;s just a G chord and an A chord oscillating back and forth&hellip; it could be functioning as IV-V in D major, but to confirm D as the tonic key, we need a cadence, and we never get it. The effect that Lydian has is that we get functional relationships like IV-V, but we can never confirm with V-I, so how do we know what the &ldquo;home&rdquo; pitch is?</p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m also totally willing to debate-team this with Jim in class. Also studio version vs. live version are COMPLETELY different.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong> (referencing list&nbsp;from Kate):&nbsp;<span> I thought &ldquo;Another Brick in the Wall&rdquo; was in C major, but you have it as D Dorian??</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Jim:&nbsp;</strong>That's the thing about Lydian -- it really wants to resolve to Ionian, and what Jane's Addiction did to keep the ambiguity was brilliant.&nbsp; Would any of the kids remember the Jetsons' theme for an example of Lydian?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; And the Simpsons' theme isn't pure Lydian, so that's out.&nbsp; There's a theme that opens Disney(?) movies that's a perfect example, but I can't find it.&nbsp; Google sucks at finding musical themes, compared to finding everything else.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Kate</strong>:&nbsp;Two things to consider when deciding on the mode;&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>1. What is the key signature (which sharps and flats are used)?&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. What is the &ldquo;home&rdquo; pitch?&nbsp;</div>
<div>With ABITW, we have no sharps and flats in any of the chords, right?&nbsp;</div>
<div>BUT the ends of phrases most often return to D and also depart from D. So, starting on D If we build a scale with no sharps and flats, the #6th scale degree implies the Dorian mode. &nbsp;</div>
<div>When the key signature does not match the &ldquo;home&rdquo; pitch (or the tonic), then chances are you are probably working in a mode. If key signature (sharps and flats used) matches the key, then you are in Ionian (major) mode. (This is arguably another side effect of colonialism.... but that&rsquo;s for a different seminar.)&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>The title theme from &ldquo;Troy&rdquo; is Lydian:&nbsp;</span><br /><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rb5woCQgcg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v%3D2Rb5woCQgcg&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518874711916000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo0w8quKovCNtIrHoHj6qIb-SETQ">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rb5woCQgcg</a>
