<h1>Final Project Ideas</h1>

<ol>
<li>Timpani - researching why it sounds pitched despite being a drum, among other things!&nbsp;Here is a website to inspire you: <a href="http://wtt.pauken.org/?page_id=30" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://wtt.pauken.org/?page_id=30</a></li>
<li>Prof. Rob Hart's demo with body of a violin / wood cut with a function generator and crushed tea leaves showing resonant modes. Recreate this experiment, create multiple&nbsp;consecutive modes, study coupling of different modes, and what happens when you shave off slices of the wood one layer at a time. Study different materials.</li>
<li>Exploration in the characterization of the transfer function of a room and convolution reverb systems&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_reverb">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_reverb</a>. For inspiration on rooms coming to life, read this&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room,">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room,</a>&nbsp;and listen here:<a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAxHlLK3Oyk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DfAxHlLK3Oyk&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1519998918914000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHcqOiWvqlE44glo2ZCHgYqCINp-g" data-preview-alt="Alvin Lucier - I Am Sitting In A Room">Alvin Lucier - I Am Sitting In A Room</a></li>
<li>Create an effects pedal for guitar/keyboard/voice. Use an existing effect or come up with your own, describe mathematically, and build a circuit that implements the effect. Can be a known effect/circuit but should include some analysis of the output relative to the "clean" signal.</li>
<li>Research project on the evolution of the human auditory/vocalization systems or an interesting acoustic phenomena in animals.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Research project related to a historically significant acoustic event (e.g., use of acoustics in ancient architecture, invention of phonograph/telephone/etc and cultural fallout, acoustic radar during early 20th century warfare, etc).</li>
<li>Composition project, using a DAW or the instrument you created in earlier lab assignments.</li>
<li>Design, construct, analyze an instrument (electrical, mechanical, or electromechanical).</li>
<li>Related to 8, but slightly different. Model a physical instrument. e.g. a stringed instrument, mallet percussion or even a Hammond organ! Implement a digital version of the instrument. How accurate does it sound and what can we learn from the pitfalls of modeling (about hidden complexities of the sound source) perhaps?</li>
<li>Build a "Leslie speaker" and analyze its effect on a sound source.</li>
<li>Build guitar pickups - Talk to Maddie and Rob.</li>
<li>Analyzing sounds from Gongs and Himalayan Bowls (person who did the demo is willing to let you record sounds on her instruments), look for resonance, spectrum timbre characteristics that are different than other similar instruments.&nbsp;</li>
