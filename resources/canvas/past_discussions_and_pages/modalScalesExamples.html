<h1>Modal Scales Examples</h1>

<p>The following are examples that Kate Pukinskis and Jim MacArthur put together as an exercise in the different modal scales that we touched on in class. It is helpful to refer to <a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/75224/files/folder/Lesson%206%20%26%207%20-%20Mathematical%20Framework%20behind%20music?preview=5426487" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the following sheet </a>and practice putting the notes for each scale in that sheet if you are not familiar with&nbsp;them as you are looking at the songs below.&nbsp;</p>
<div>Just to recap, one of&nbsp;the seven modes that were discussed&nbsp;is&nbsp;rarely used (Locrian), so that leaves six, and two you probably already know from most exposure to music education: major (Ionian) and natural minor (Aeolian), so that leaves four new ones.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order, using only the white keys and starting on C, here are some examples of where you find these modes:<br />Ionian (start on C) is simply the major scale.<br />Dorian (start on D, for Dorian): &nbsp;Many&nbsp;Celtic&nbsp;folk songs ("Scarborough Fair").&nbsp; Also "Eleanor Rigby" (Beatles).<br />Phrygian (start on E)&nbsp;is common in many Spanish folk songs.</div>
<div>Lydian (start on F) is a major scale with a sharp four, used many&nbsp;John Williams film scores:<br /><a class="external youtubed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6FbC96CX4E" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dx6FbC96CX4E&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1518873422031000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSUSkHS4HDbxnNSA7mSJGjgfcuKw" data-preview-alt="Film Scoring 101 - The Lydian Mode">Film Scoring 101 - The Lydian Mode<span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><a class="youtubed" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6FbC96CX4E"><img class="media_comment_thumbnail" src="https://canvas.harvard.edu/images/play_overlay.png" alt="Film Scoring 101 - The Lydian Mode" /></a></div>
<div>Mixolydian (start on G) is a major scale with a flat seven.&nbsp; Think the beginning of "Norwegian Wood" or Blind Melon's "No Rain".</div>
<div>Aeolian (start on A) is just the natural minor.</div>
<div>Locrian (start on B) is rare enough that you can safely ignore it.</div>

</div>
<div>Note from Prof. Diana Dabby (Olin College) on above symphony:</div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Gorecki is loaded with modes:&nbsp; each instrumental entrance is based on a different mode.&nbsp; Gorecki uses each of the 7 modes (given on the handout), including Locrian!, at least once before the double bar at m. 320.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The lower double basses start the piece with a melody in E Aeolian (I demonstrated this last Thursday).&nbsp; You hear the complete E Aeolian scale in mm. 1-12.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called E Aeolian because the Aeolian mode is transposed to have the same whole step/half step structure as A Aeolian (given in the handout as w h w w h w w), but now starting on E.&nbsp; Then the upper double basses enter with the melody, but now&nbsp;in B Phrygian (mm. 26-37 give the first instance of the completed B Phrygian scale).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Next, the lower cellos enter with the melody, but now based on F# Locrian (mm. 51 &ndash; 62 give the first instance of the completed F# Locrian scale).&nbsp;&nbsp;The upper cellos follow with C Lydian (mm. 76 &ndash; 87 for the first instance of the completed C Lydian scale).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The succeeding melodic entrances continue to progress by circle of 5ths:&nbsp; lower violas (G Ionian, mm. 101-112 for the first completed G Ionian scale), upper violas (D Mixolydian, mm. 126-137 for the first completed D Mixolydian scale), lower 2<sup>nd</sup> violins (A Dorian, mm. 151 &ndash; 162 for the first completed A Dorian scale), and so on.</p>

<div><strong>An example worth considering is:</strong></div>
<div><a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Another Brick in the Wall</a>We&nbsp;have no sharps and flats in any of the chords, right?&nbsp;</div>
<div>But the ends of phrases most often return to D and also depart from D. So, starting on D If we build a scale with no sharps and flats, the #6th scale degree implies the Dorian mode. &nbsp;</div>
<div>When the key signature does not match the &ldquo;home&rdquo; pitch (or the tonic), then chances are you are probably working in a mode. If key signature (sharps and flats used) matches the key, then you are in Ionian (major) mode. (This is arguably another side effect of colonialism.... but that&rsquo;s for a different seminar.)&nbsp;</div>
