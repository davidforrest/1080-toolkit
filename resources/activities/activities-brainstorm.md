# Activities Brainstorm

## Goal
-	Add more hands-on learning experiences to remote lectures and create a stress-free way for students to interact with the material and start learning skills they can use in labs and final projects.
-	Differentiate them from bigger projects done in lab, they should be a lot simpler and short (5-20 minutes) as a demo for a corresponding lecture.
