How do differential equations relate to music?

These equations may seem useless ofr musicians, but they are very useful for engineers who are dealing with musicians! Waveforms are generated by a physical object that’s resonating, ringing. resonating systems are best described by differential equations, they can’t be described by first order differential equations. First order differential equations are like pushing a spoon through oatmeal. If it’s a first order system, the result won’t have an oscillating behavior. provides a construct that lets you intuit some property of the system. When we’re talking about energy sloshing back and forth, as soon as you get outta first order (like building our oscillator).. Or if you’ve got something like a pendulum, you can’t describe it unless you have a differential equation.
