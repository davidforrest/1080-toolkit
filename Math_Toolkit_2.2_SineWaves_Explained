What are sine waves?

A sine wave is a curve that represents a repetitive signal. Sine waves come from trigonometry, when a right triangle is inscribed inside a circle, spinning in time.

Starting with a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the height of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse:


Next, imagine that the hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of a circle:


Now start that circle spinning, which represents repetitions in time.

If you rotate that around 360 degrees and take the sine of the angle, you’ve created a sine wave.

And here you can see triangles inscribed in this circle, where sine is the height of the opposite leg of the triangle, and cosine is the adjacent leg: https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/sine_waves/opt_sine_triangle.html


Here, you can see how a sine wave is derived from a spinning circle: https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/explained_sine_definition.html


Any sine wave can be described by three numbers: its amplitude (the height of the highest point of the wave), its period (the distance between repetitions of the wave), and its phase (the position of the wave relative to a reference point, like time = 0).
