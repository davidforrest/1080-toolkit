Calculus and differential equations work together.

You have lots of signals. Maybe it’s a sound wave moving through air, or a guitar string moving back and forth, or a sine wave vibrating up and down. If you want to know how fast something is changing, that’s a derivative.

Calculus is how you find a derivative.

Once you can find derivatives, differential equations let you analyze how derivatives change.

Calculus is the study of things that change over time - and that’s very useful, because in our world there are a lot of things that change over time. From the sound of a speaker to the temperature to the flight of a rocket to the voltage in a circuit, our world is filled with things that change, and calculus lets us analyze all of them.
