        <h2>How do differential equations relate to music?</h2>
        <p>Sound waves are generated by a physical object that is resonating, and resonating systems are best described by differential equations that are higher than first order. A first order system has no acceleration, so the result won’t have an oscillating behavior.</p>

        <p>In a second order differential equation, a second derivative of the function introduces acceleration and creates the oscillating behavior that you’d see in, say, a spring or a pendulum. Once you use a second or higher order differential equation, you can model the movement of energy back and forth, which can model musical systems that are more complex.</p>

        <h2 class="question">What are differential equations?</h2>

        <p>
        A differential equation is a mathematical equation that relates a function with its derivatives. Since derivatives represent the rate of change of a function, relating an equation to its derivatives can be useful in showing change over time. They allow us to model more complex motion than just a single function can.
        </p>

        <p>
        Think of a mass on a spring bouncing up and down. We can use Newton’s second law to characterize this motion which states:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center">$F = ma$</p>
          
        <!-- F(force)= m(mass) \times a(acceleration) -->

        <p>
        Here, $F$ stands for <em>force</em>, $m$ stands for <em>mass</em>, and $a$ stands for <em>acceleration</em>. In this case the <em>mass</em> is constant, so we only need to consider <em>force</em> and <em>acceleration</em> as variables in creating our differential equation. 
        </p>

        <p>
        By another physical principle, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke’s Law</a>, we know the force of a spring is equal to a constant $k$ multiplied by the displacement of the spring. Combining these two concepts, we can say:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center">$kx=ma$</p>

        <p>Here, $x$ is <em>displacement</em> and $a$ is <em>acceleration</em> of the <em>mass</em> as a function of <em>time</em>. As we mentioned in the derivatives and integrals section, if you take the derivative of displacement over time twice, you get the acceleration over time. So we can rewrite the equation of the movement of the spring in terms of one function, displacement over time, and its derivatives. So we can say:
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:center">$-kx = m \frac {d^2x}{dt^2} $</p>

        <p>
        Here, the $\frac {d^2x}{dt^2}$ is the <em>second derivative of $x$</em>. This differential equations allows us to model the complex motion that is oscillating in one simple equation. This is useful because you can relate the movement of the mass on the spring with its acceleration with only one function, instead of two.
