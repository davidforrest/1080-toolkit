<h2>
How do differential equations relate to music?
</h2>

<p>
Sound waves are generated by a physical object that is resonating, and resonating systems are best described by differential equations that are higher than first order. A first order system has no acceleration, so the result won’t have an oscillating behavior.
</p>

<p>
In a second order differential equation, a second derivative of the function introduces acceleration and creates the oscillating behavior that you’d see in, say, a spring or a pendulum. Once you use a second or higher order differential equation, you can model the movement of energy back and forth, which can model musical systems that are more complex.
