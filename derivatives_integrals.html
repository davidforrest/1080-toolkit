<h2>
What are derivatives and integrals?
</h2>

<p>
Derivatives and integrals come from calculus, the study of functions and how they change over time. In mathematics, this refers to how the slope of a function (such as a line or a polynomial) can change as you move along the graph. If you are looking at the graph of a horizontal line for example, the slope is always constant. If you wanted to characterize the slope of a more complicated function, like a parabola, you could pick individual points on the graph and find the slope, but you couldn’t find the slope at <strong>every</strong> point. That’s where derivatives come in. A derivative is an expression that gives the slope of a function at any point you plug into it.
</p>

<p>
What does the change of a function over time really mean though? Well, think of traveling in a car. We can say the function in this case is your distance at every time (at 0 sec, 1 sec, 2 sec etc.). Now say you want the velocity you’re traveling at, you would want to find how your distance traveled changes over time, or the derivative. So in this case, distance is the function and velocity is the derivative. If you wanted to find your velocity during a certain time interval you could just take your distance divided by the amount of time it took you to cover that distance; however, with a derivative, you could find the velocity of any instant during that car trip.
</p>

<p>
While derivatives represent how the slope of a function changes over time, an integral represents how a function <em>accumulates</em> over time. The best way to think about these two concepts is graphically. Picture the graph of a horizontal line. If you found the slope at a given point on the graph (which in this case is zero), you are finding the derivative of the function. If you found the area underneath the function on a certain interval, such as 0 to 3 (which in this case is just the y value of the horizontal line times 3), you would be finding the integral.
</p>

<p>
What can the accumulation of a function actually be used for? Let’s go back to our traveling in a car example. Now let’s say that you know your velocity and you want to find your distance over time. You could graph your velocity as a function of time and find the area underneath the graph. If your velocity graph is a polynomial with curves, it’s a little more challenging to get the area than the horizontal line we mentioned before. Instead, you could approximate the area by taking small rectangular sections of the graph that are close to modeling the actual curve. The more rectangular sections you slice it into, the more accurate your approximation of the area. By taking the integral of the function, you are taking an infinite number of slices and therefore getting the exact area and in this case, the exact distance over time.
</p>

<p>
So, if the derivative of distance is velocity and the integral of velocity is distance, we see there is an inverse relationship between these two concepts and that you can use one to find the other. This is why an integral is also called an antiderivative. These two ways of representing changes in functions are interconnected and together make up calculus.
