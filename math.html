      <div class="q-a-container">

        <h2>How do sine waves relate to music?</h2>

        <p>A sine wave is a very simple way to represent a repetitive signal, and it gives us a foundation for analyzing more complex sounds. It’s possible to split a sound up in lots of ways, for example, synthesizers often use square, triangle, and sawtooth waves to create complex sounds. But engineers prefer sine waves to analyze sounds because the math is much easier to work with.</p>

        <p>Any repetitive signal can be broken down into individual sine waves that have the same period as the original signal. An engineer can then analyze each sine wave one at a time and put them back together, modeling the original sound. Being able to analyze sine waves can also help us understand the principles behind familiar musical products, like noise cancelling headphones, which work by calculating differences in phase.</p>

        <h2>What are sine waves?</h2>

        <p>
        Sine waves come from trigonometry, which is the study of how the side lengths and angles of a triangle affect each other. According to trigonometry, the “sine” of any given angle of a triangle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the longest side of the triangle- the hypotenuse. But this “sine” of a triangle is just one value, and the sine we’ll consider is those single sine values as a function of time. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Now imagine that same triangle is a right triangle and you draw a circle around it, where the hypotenuse is the radius of the circle and the vertex of the angle we were referencing before is the center. See this <a href="https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/sine_waves/opt_sine_triangle.html">visual representation</a> of the sine of a center angle of a triangle inscribed in a circle.
        </p>

        <p>
        If we spin the circle, we add the dimension of time, because it takes a certain time for the circle to complete each rotation. If you take the sine of that initial angle we mentioned before as the circle completes a 360 degree rotation, you’ve created a sine wave, which is the sine of that center angle as a function of time. See this <a href="https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/explained_sine_definition.html">visual representation</a> of how a sine wave is derived from a spinning circle.  
        </p>

        <p>
        As the value of sine oscillates as a function of time, graphically it looks like a continuous series of waves. This wave can be defined by three values: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>amplitude</strong>, the height of the highest point of the wave,</li>
          <li><strong>period</strong>, the distance between repetitions of the wave, and</li>
          <li><strong>phase</strong>, the position of the wave relative to a reference point (e.g., time = 0 seconds)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

          <div class="q-a-container">
            <h2>How do logarithms relate to music?</h2>
            <p>Humans, computers, amplifiers, and musical tuning systems each rely on different numerical systems. Our standard way of counting is based in multiples of 10, but a computer thinks in multiples of 2, because computers are fundamentally built on voltages that are either on or off.</p>

            <p>Likewise, we don’t just think of musical pitches in a linear sequence from lowest to highest. We hear different octaves as though they are the same note, and each octave is a doubling of the frequency of the previous octave. Our ears also work this way with amplitude. When you turn up the volume knob on your stereo, each notch isn’t a fixed increment, but a logarithmic increment. A doubling of the amplitude maps into a linear change in our perception. This also means that doubling the amplitude of the vibration of a string or doubling the amount of air that a subwoofer moves doesn’t double the loudness we actually hear.</p>

            <p>We also use logarithms to calculate the pitches in our musical tuning system, and this is what allows us to play the same music in any key. The “equal tempered” system means that each of our 12 notes is equally spaced within an octave, the result of a base-12 logarithm.</p>

            <h2>What are logarithms?</h2>

            <p>Logarithms capture the relationship between multiplication and addition. Logarithms are formally defined as <em>undoing exponentiation</em>: so if $2^3 = 8$, then $log_{2} 8 = 3$. But they also have the neat property that $log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)$. So logarithms turn multiplying into adding.</p>

            <p>A “logarithmic scale” means that a +1 difference on that scale actually represents a multiplication by some value (usually *2, or *10). Think of every value on the scale being passed through a $log(x)$ before reaching the scale. Volume, pitch, and earthquakes are all measured on logarithmic scales.</p>

            <h2 class="question">How do complex numbers relate to music?</h2>
            <p>
              Complex numbers set the stage for some very convenient ways of working with sine waves (and other signals that repeat over time). It’s possible to capture both the amplitude and phase of a sine wave using a single complex number, and also to express those relationships graphically. Much of the math behind signals is built using complex numbers to take advantage of this efficiency.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="q-a-container">

            <h2 class="question">What are complex numbers?</h2>
            <p>
              Complex numbers are a number system where the square root of $-1$ is declared to be a valid number. For example, the number $4$ has two square roots: $2$ and $-2$. But what number would you square to get $-4$? This is where the square root of $-1$ (usually called $i$ for “imaginary”) comes to the rescue.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:center">$i = \sqrt{-1}$</p>

            <p>
            A complex number can be expressed in terms of two components: a real part and an imaginary part. The real part is what we’re all used to when we think of numbers: like $1$, $3$, $5$, $\pi$, and so forth. The imaginary part is a real number multiplied by $i$.
            </p>

            <p>
            Complex numbers are usually graphed on the “complex plane”. You may be familiar with the number line, a one-dimensional line that describes all real numbers, with zero in the middle, positive numbers on the right and negatives on the left. the complex plane is a two-dimensional plane, where zero is still in the middle, positives on the right, and negatives on the left, but this time multiples of $i$ go <em>upwards</em> from zero, and multiples of negative $i$ go downwards from zero. So to graph a number $a+bi$, you’d go right or left depending on the value of $a$, then go up or down depending on the value of 
            $b$.
            </p>

            <p>
            The following are examples of complex numbers: $1+2i$, $1.56+10i$. All real numbers can also be represented as complex numbers by having a zero imaginary part: $2+0i$, $-100+0i$, and so on.
            </p>

            <p>
            So multiplication, an abstract, algebraic thing to do, is transformed into rotating and scaling, a visual, geometric thing to do. That’s the beauty of complex numbers!
