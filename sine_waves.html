<h1>Math Toolkit: Sine Waves</h1>

<h2>
How do sine waves relate to music?
</h2>

<p>
A sine wave is a very simple way to represent a repetitive signal, and it gives us a foundation for analyzing more complex sounds. It’s possible to split a sound up in lots of ways, for example, synthesizers often use square, triangle, and sawtooth waves to create complex sounds. But engineers prefer sine waves to analyze sounds because the math is much easier to work with.
</p>

<p>
Any repetitive signal can be broken down into individual sine waves that have the same period as the original signal. An engineer can then analyze each sine wave one at a time and put them back together, modeling the original sound. Being able to analyze sine waves can also help us understand the principles behind familiar musical products, like noise cancelling headphones, which work by calculating differences in phase.

What are sine waves?
</h2>

</p>

<p>
A sine wave is a curve that represents a repetitive signal. Sine waves come from trigonometry, when a right triangle is inscribed inside a circle, spinning in time.
</p>

<p>
Starting with a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the height of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse:
</p>

<p>
Next, imagine that the hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of a circle:
</p>

<p>
Now start that circle spinning, which represents repetitions in time.
</p>

<p>
If you rotate that around 360 degrees and take the sine of the angle, you’ve created a sine wave.
</p>

<p>
And here you can see triangles inscribed in this circle, where sine is the height of the opposite leg of the triangle, and cosine is the adjacent leg: <a href="https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/sine_waves/opt_sine_triangle.html">https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/sine_waves/opt_sine_triangle.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Here, you can see how a sine wave is derived from a spinning circle: <a href="https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/explained_sine_definition.html">https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/explained_sine_definition.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Any sine wave can be described by three numbers: its amplitude (the height of the highest point of the wave), its period (the distance between repetitions of the wave), and its phase (the position of the wave relative to a reference point, like time = 0).
