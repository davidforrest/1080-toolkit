      <h1>Sine Waves</h1>
      <div class="q-a-container">

        <h2>How do sine waves relate to music?</h2>

        <p>A sine wave is a very simple way to represent a repetitive signal, and it gives us a foundation for analyzing more complex sounds. It’s possible to split a sound up in lots of ways, for example, synthesizers often use square, triangle, and sawtooth waves to create complex sounds. But engineers prefer sine waves to analyze sounds because the math is much easier to work with.</p>

        <p>Any repetitive signal can be broken down into individual sine waves that have the same period as the original signal. An engineer can then analyze each sine wave one at a time and put them back together, modeling the original sound. Being able to analyze sine waves can also help us understand the principles behind familiar musical products, like noise cancelling headphones, which work by calculating differences in phase.</p>

        <h2>What are sine waves?</h2>

        <p>
        Sine waves come from trigonometry, which is the study of how the side lengths and angles of a triangle affect each other. According to trigonometry, the “sine” of any given angle of a triangle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the longest side of the triangle- the hypotenuse. But this “sine” of a triangle is just one value, and the sine we’ll consider is those single sine values as a function of time. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Now imagine that same triangle is a right triangle and you draw a circle around it, where the hypotenuse is the radius of the circle and the vertex of the angle we were referencing before is the center. See this <a href="https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/sine_waves/opt_sine_triangle.html">visual representation</a> of the sine of a center angle of a triangle inscribed in a circle.
        </p>

        <p>
        If we spin the circle, we add the dimension of time, because it takes a certain time for the circle to complete each rotation. If you take the sine of that initial angle we mentioned before as the circle completes a 360 degree rotation, you’ve created a sine wave, which is the sine of that center angle as a function of time. See this <a href="https://zsteinberg.github.io/explanaria/examples/explained_sine_definition.html">visual representation</a> of how a sine wave is derived from a spinning circle.  
        </p>

        <p>
        As the value of sine oscillates as a function of time, graphically it looks like a continuous series of waves. This wave can be defined by three values: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>amplitude</strong>, the height of the highest point of the wave,</li>
          <li><strong>period</strong>, the distance between repetitions of the wave, and</li>
          <li><strong>phase</strong>, the position of the wave relative to a reference point (e.g., time = 0 seconds)</li>
        </ul>
          
        </p>
