A differential equation is any equation relating a function to its derivatives.

Differential equations pop up in so many different disciplines including but not limited to physics, engineering, economics, biology, and so on. Differential equations can describe many physical and nonphysical phenomena that would otherwise be very difficult to quantify.

Almost everyone has seen Newton’s famous second law: Force = MassAcceleration. This equation can in fact be written as a differential equation since acceleration is the second derivative of position with respect to time. If, for instance, we want to model the motion of a mass on a spring, Newton’s second law can give us a differential equation by invoking that the force is equal to the spring’s stiffness times its displacement from equilibrium. Quantifying and modeling the position of this mass-spring system is a matter of solving this differential equation.

Solving a differential equation is a matter of determining a function that obeys the given differential equation. For instance, what is the solution to this differential equation?
dxdt = 0
This equation is saying that some function x, when differentiated with respect to time, is 0 throughout all values of time. Equivalently, what function’s slope is 0 or horizontal? We know a constant function’s slope is always equal to 0. So is the answer x(t) = 4 or x(t) = 100?

Well, they’re both right. In fact, any constant function x(t) = C where C is a constant is a valid solution to that differential equation. A differential equation might have one explicit solution or it might have an infinite number of solutions. We might need more information about the function or its derivatives to explicitly define the solution of a particular differential equation. These bits of information are called initial conditions.

Differential equations can be split up and classified by type. Ordinary differential equations only involve one independent variable while partial differential equations involve two or more independent variables. The order of a differential equation is simply the highest derivative present in the equation while the degree of a differential equation is the power of the highest derivative.

For instance: (d2ydx2)3+5dydx = 3x2 is a second order third degree differential equation because the highest derivative is the first term, which also is raised to the third power.
