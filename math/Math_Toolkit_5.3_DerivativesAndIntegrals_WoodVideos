Prof. Wood's Overview Videos:

	Intro to Derivatives:
Definition of a derivative and examples of what a derivative is graphically. What makes a function “differentiable” and what a solution to a differential equation represents.

Properties of Derivatives:
Multiplying by a constant, addition rule, product rule, chain rule, and exponent rule.
